            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Relation, which I ſtand unto you in, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been made Signal, at the firſt, by your very great Uprightneſs and Generoſity, and ever ſince, foſter'd by your
<pb facs="tcp:49802:3"/> no leſs Love and Bounty, I have often wiſh'd I could add one more Ornament to it, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it remarkable in its Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Could I thus do, that Fidelity, at leaſt, and Incorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Patronage, which is the more your Own, by being ſo little the Virtue of the Age, might, in hopes of like Succeſs, be by Others in like manner Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. But I am very ſenſible how far, in this reſpect, my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſhort of my Deſires: And yet I need not be over-much concern'd that ſo it is; ſince a Conſcionable Endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge mine Office is by You eſteemed the beſt Requital: And, in this, I truſt, I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:49802:3"/> never, to my Ability, be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. However, Sir, at the Perſuaſions of ſome, whoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I much eſteem, (if their Kindneſs to me hath not ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing biaſs'd it,) I have preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to offer theſe Diſcourſes, (ſuch as they be,) as a publick Acknowledgment of your many Favours. I can ſay little for them, but that I meant them Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; and for their Subjects ſake, I do not altogether Deſpair of their being accepted: Which, it may be, they the rather will be, becauſe they are, in part, the effect of that Sacred Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which your free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Munificence gave me the firſt Encouragements. Neither,
<pb facs="tcp:49802:4"/> by being your Peculiar, would I have them Unſerviceable to the good of Others more at large; of which, yourſelf both have been, are, and yet further will be, ſo Worthy an Inſtrument. It is too manifeſt, Sir, that the moſt do look upon the Divine Laws as a Task, and have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Grudging while they Obey them; ſuch as a Slave perceives under a Burden, which he bears with Diſcontent, and would fain throw off. I am therefore not unwilling to contribute that little which I can, to the Curing of this Malady; by making out unto Men, that our <hi>Saviours Commands</hi> have in them what may ſtrongly allure <hi>our Love;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49802:4"/> as being the higheſt Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and Happineſs of our Nature; and thereupon ſhould be deſired and delighted in: And that the <hi>Violation</hi> of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is a thing <hi>Foul</hi> and <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> as caſting the greateſt Stain and Deformity upon Men; and ſhould therefore be ſhunn'd and abhorr'd. I muſt confeſs, there may ſeem but little need of ſuch Treatiſes as This; becauſe our Nation abounds with ſo many, and ſo very good ones; and, I fear, their Number, with ſome, taketh away from their Value. But, conſidering that there is a Sphere, in which ſome Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will be more Active than others, though of greater Worth;
<pb facs="tcp:49802:5"/> and that Acquaintance, Good Will and Curioſity, will ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bid <hi>Take up and Read,</hi> when otherwiſe the Book would have lain clos'd and untouch'd; I could not tell, but it might be ſo with This. And I would hope, that the Favour which I have found in theſe parts, and Your Name prefixed, will, through Gods Bleſſing, make way for, and give a more kindly Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto, the enſuing Dialogue. And while the Age is, at the preſent, ſo hotly engaged in the Diſputing and Controverſial Way, poſſibly, Sir, <hi>a quiet and peaceable Diſcourſe,</hi> of things that highly concern all, may be thought not Unſeaſonable; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:49802:5"/> as an Admonition to ſome, who, intent upon what they ſhould <hi>righty Think,</hi> are leſs mindful of what they ſhould <hi>religiouſly Do;</hi> Or, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to others, who, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Contention, and Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Event, find their chief Reſt in God, and his Righteous Laws. The Names which carry on this Dialogue have their Honours in Sacred VVrit; and do import by their Signification very VVorthy Perſons. And ſuch I was willing they ſhould be; <hi>THIS a Lover of God; THAT a Pious and Good Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;</hi> that their Words might ſway the more with myſelf, when I ſhould think it was not I, but
<pb facs="tcp:49802:6"/> They, that Spake; and that, with Others alſo, who ſhould pleaſe to Read them, they might bear a greater Authority than from Me they could have had. And though, I doubt, they are much ſhort of what they ſhould be, yet the leſs Knowing, if Attentive, will find what they may be informed by; and the more Underſtanding, if Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, what they will not utterly diſlike. But, Sir, whatever the following Sheets will be to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to yourſelf they are no more than a bare Signification of Reſpect; ſeeing they can add little to your Knowledge, which is large and extenſive; and are not wanted by your Practice,
<pb facs="tcp:49802:6"/> which few have the Heart to reach unto. It is, I know, more eaſie to You to Do worthy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than pleaſing to Hear of them, when done: But I cannot, in Gratitude, as I ſerve at the Altar, but, amongſt many Others, take notice of One, <hi>viz.</hi> The Honorary Reſpect you have ſhew'd to the Church, in freely giving up your Impropriate Tithes, as an Addition to her Maintenance. I hope it will be returned into your Boſom with large Advantage; ſince, by thoſe Few that have prevail'd with themſelves to do the like, it hath been found a ſure way for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bleſt. And if more, who have the Power, durſt make the
<pb facs="tcp:49802:7"/> Experiment, I queſtion not, but They alſo would find it ſo to be.</p>
            <p>That you may long Live, and have an Increaſe of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the Increaſe of your Years, is the Prayer of,</p>

               <p>THE Inducements that Chriſtians have to Love the Divine Law. Love was the moving cauſe of our Lord's becoming our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. The Greatneſs of our Lawgivers Perſon. All the troubleſome Ceremonies of the Old Law are done away by the Laws of our Lord; and this, not by his Will alone, but by the admirable manifeſtation of his Goodneſs and Wiſdom. How the Jews urging the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſs of their Law is from hence anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and how their way of Speaking is corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, when they ſay our Lawgiver hath vilified and deſtroy'd their Laws. Only ſuch Laws are enjoyn'd by our Lord, as have in them an Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Goodneſs, or elſe are for Ends abſolutely Good, and ſuch as are diſcernable by every one. Though the Jews had ſome Inferiour Laws ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Temper and Climate, which did the better fit them for the obſervance of thoſe Laws which were Moral, yet we have not the leſs reaſon to Love the Laws of our Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all Good, without any mixture of ſuch Inferiour Laws, which may be agreeable to different Climates where Chriſtians Live, and which may promote the Precepts of our Lord, are not by thoſe Precepts excluded. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Laws are ſuch alſo as will, in our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, much comply with our particular Way and Temper. The Moral Laws, which were given to the Jews, are by our Lord more fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given. The Laws that reſpect ourſelves are
<pb facs="tcp:49802:8"/> properly belonging io the New Teſtament: At leaſt, are there only directly and openly injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd. The Objection anſwer'd, that ſo far is the Chriſtian Law from being more clearly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it requires us to admit of ſome things relating to Faith, which no one living can conceive how they ſhould be. The Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of making our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings to yield to our Faith. <hi>P. 35.</hi>

               <p>THE Severities of the Chriſtian Laws are not unreaſonable; neither do they reduce us to ſuch ſtraights, as cannot be gone through without a great deal of uneaſineſs, if at all. The Deſign of our Lord is not to beat down our Natural Inclinations and Appetites, but to rectifie them. Our Diſpoſitions, if well managed, not averſe from a right Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Laws of Chriſt do not daſh the pleaſure of Converſation, by threatning idle Words with the Day of Judgment. The Loving of Enemies, while they perſiſt to be injurious, is in itſelf not unmeet, but highly equitable, in caſe the Hiſtory of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be true. Faſting and Abſtinence not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable; nor the parting with Eſtates and Lives for the aſſerting of the Goſpel. From the Laws of Chriſt we have a fair way for the Pardon of all Sins. What the Law of Faith requires of us. How much it is different from the Old Law. What the Law of Repentance is. Too many make Faith and Repentance to ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:49802:9"/> in oppoſition to the other Laws of our Lord. How the Laws being done away, which was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on Stones, is to be underſtood. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Sin, cannot without the greateſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity be wreſted to the further and more ſafe committing of Sin. The Examples of the Thief on the Croſs, and of the Labourers in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard at the Eleventh Hour conſider'd, none of the Divine Laws unſuitable to one another. Theſe Laws of themſelves are grievous unto none. As they have relation only to Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the welfare of Men in this World, they do far ſurpaſs thoſe of the moſt noted Lawgivers; they by no means do favour the Opinion, that Right of Poſſeſſion is Founded in Grace. And that it is Lawful to reſiſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes in the Maintenance of True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They make the Man truly beautiful within. <hi>P. 66.</hi>

It is impoſſible, there ſhould be any True Happineſs without theſe Laws. From the inward Excellence of them, and thoſe admirable Motives annexed to them, there is a ſubſtantial Proof of their Divinity and Truth. No Man hath ever deſerved to be ſo much honoured among, Men as our Lord hath done. Thoſe who faithfully give up their Names unto him, have the Precedence of all others.

               <p>NOt a few think themſelves ſecure in their actings, if they can ſhew, that ſome good Men in Holy Writ, or ſome well accounted of ſince, have done the like. Examples of Good Men to be imitated no further than they have the Laws of Chriſt for their Rule and Warrant. They can of themſelves lay no Obligation upon us. The Holy Men we read of in Scripture, were not ſent into the World to be a Rule to all Others in the Things they acted. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty of Examples very great. Their Inſufficiency. None of the Actions of our Bleſſed Lord, from his
<pb facs="tcp:49802:10"/> Example merely, and without a Law, did lay any Obligation upon us to Imitate them. The Laws of Chriſt reach to all Moral Actions. No Examples of Goodneſs beyond what is included in thoſe Laws. Inferences concerning the Examples in Holy Writ. In thoſe things where the Law of God is Silent, Prudence is to be our Guide. Examples, though of themſelves they lay no Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon us, are yet of uſe. Thoſe which bear the Image of the Laws of Chriſt, are given us for Incentives and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Obedience. When Divine Laws are queſtion'd as to their Senſe, Examples, upon occaſion, may be Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of them.

<pb facs="tcp:49802:11"/> Devotion raiſed to a much greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by having our Lord and the Holy Spirit ſo nearly concerned in it.

                  <p>You rightly ſay, what the word <hi>Law</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as ſpoken by our Pſalmiſt; God's Will being written, at that time, no further than as it made up the Jewiſh Oeconomy. As it hath been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſince, it hath relation to Men in a far wider ſenſe, whereſoever planted upon the Face of the Earth. Yea, even thoſe Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which are retained in the Evangelical Diſpenſation, ceaſe to bind as they were given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and are Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory now from another Lawgiver Jeſus Chriſt. But yet ſtill they are to be acknowledged God's Laws; and we may even now uſe theſe words, <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi> Therefore, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> I deſire you will ſhew me theſe things.

                  <p>I ſee, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the greater ſhare of Diſcourſe muſt lie upon me; but you will have it ſo; and to my power I will obey you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As to the Inducements, which</hi> David <hi>and other holy Men of old had to love the Divine Laws,</hi> they ſeem to me to ariſe partly <hi>from its pleaſing God to give thoſe Laws;</hi> and partly <hi>from the Excellency of the Laws themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In relation to the former, I muſt confeſs that the Nature of Men ſeemeth neceſſarily to require, that Laws ſhould be given unto them. For it would have been highly irrational on <hi>Mens part</hi> not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Him as their Lord who gave them a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it would be a very great Diſhonour unto <hi>God,</hi> ſhould we think that They, whom he had made a little lower than the Angels, ſhould be left unregarded and lawleſs.</p>
                  <p>But yet when Men had fallen from their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and had in great meaſure ſullied that Law which was impreſt on their Natures, it was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very great Favour, that God, in ſtead of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them deſerved Puniſhments, ſhould chuſe a Numerous People to be his Peculiar; and ſhould himſelf repair that Law, thus obliterated within, by writing it in Tables, that it might be diſcern'd by the Eye.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the Greatneſs of Him who gives this Law; how he needs not the Services of any Creature; and alſo the Ingratitude of <hi>Man,</hi> how he diſobeyed the moſt righteous Law in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; where all the Love and Obſervance, which poſſibly he could ſhew, would not have been too much. Conſider this, I ſay, and the Law, if it carry but any favour along with it, may certainly, for the ſake of Him who gave it, be juſtly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loved.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49802:16"/>
                  <p>Neither is the Time, wherein it pleaſed God to give theſe Laws, unworthy of our Notice. So much was the Welfare of Mankind eſteemed to depend upon the Writing of Laws, that many Nations, in after Ages, contended for the Dignity of being the firſt Authors thereof. And <hi>Greece</hi> eſpecially, among the Priviledges which ſhe boaſts to have held forth to the reſt of the World, reckons this as one of the the chief. But the Honour of having the firſt Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Laws belongs to the Hebrews alone, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of whom (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> againſt <hi>Apion</hi> proveth,) the Grecian Legiſlators were but of yeſterday; and this Honour is much heightned by God's owning the immediate Relation of a King unto them, while he wrote theſe Laws. Now the Benefit of Laws, and the Glory of having Theſe given ſo early, and by ſuch an Hand, being well underſtood, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued by our Pſalmiſt, (who himſelf was a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and a King,) might well engage his Love to them.</p>

                  <p>I acknowledge the Inducement from God's thus giving the Law, to be a very fair one. Pray, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> go on to the other you mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Excellency of the Laws themſelves.</hi>

                  <p>Take it in that pious King's own words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul: The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the Simple. The Statuts of the Lord are righteous, rejoycing the Heart: The Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the Eyes. The Fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: The Judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether: More to be deſired are they than Gold, yea than much fine Gold; ſweeter alſo than Honey, and the Honey-Comb.

                  <p>I would deſire they ſhould be <hi>Fear, Love, and Gratitude; and theſe ſhewn upon Grounds every way good.</hi> There being nothing more comely, than that Subjects ſhould be with-held from offending, <hi>by Fear;</hi> moved to all Obedience, <hi>by Love;</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to Acknowledgments of Benefits and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>by Gratitude.</hi> More than Theſe I mention not; becauſe to Theſe all others, I ſuppoſe, may be reduced; and are, in effect, no other than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of them.</p>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>All theſe you ſhall find to be according to your Wiſh.</p>
                  <p>Your firſt Duty of <hi>Fear</hi> is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. (as alſo in ſundry places more,) <hi>Thou ſhalt Fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve Him; and ſwear by his Name.</hi> Their Fear is to be ſuch as not to ſcare them from him, but they are to approach unto him, and to do him Service. And for the deciding of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and eſtabliſhing of Truth, they are to uſe his Name ſolemnly in an Oath.</p>
                  <p>And a <hi>right good Ground</hi> there is for ſuch a Fear, from the Power and Juſtice of God; ſuch as can, and will, inflict Puniſhments on them when they wilfully tranſgreſs; and this to the utmoſt of their Deſerts. The Deſtruction of the Old World for its Impiety;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49802:17"/> The Overwhelming of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> The Earths opening her Mouth, and ſwallowing up <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi> and numerous other Inſtances of the like Nature, were hereof Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſufficient. So that this Law of Fearing God, as a Prince and Lawgiver, manifeſts itſelf to be built on a ſure and laſting Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond Duty <hi>of Love</hi> is commanded <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength.</hi> It is not to be a faint, and an unconſtant Love; but one that is ſtrong, and will not fail: For the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God with all the Heart, and Soul, and Strength, doth not only import the greateſt vigour of Love, but the greateſt duration of it alſo. It muſt not be towards him Now, and anon quite off him; but the greateſt Length it muſt have, as well as the greateſt Heighth.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>the ſtrong Inducements</hi> to this Duty were well known from the Creation of the World, which in the greateſt Goodneſs was effected; from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of God's Favour when Man had fallen; and from the manifold Loving Kindneſſes which he had ſhewed to his People in general, and to Good Men in particular. And therefore this good King could burſt forth in earneſt Exhortations to others, <hi>O Love the Lord, all ye his Saints, for the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the Faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For your third Duty, <hi>viz. Gratitude,</hi> which you would have to be ſhewed to a Lawgiver, are all thoſe Injunctions and Incitements of Praiſing God, which are ſcattered almoſt every where in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And no other Deſign had thoſe Sacrifices which were unbloody, than that Men ſhould with Thankfulneſs acknowledge God as Supream. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.12. <hi>If he offer it for a Thanksgiving;</hi> as much as to ſay, Thankfulneſs is to be offered unto God.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49802:17"/>
                  <p>And what more prevailing Motive could there be for the Obeying this Precept, than that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was poſſeſſed was of God's Bounty? It was He that gave unto the Iſraelites all that they look'd upon as their Wealth and Property: And therefore they were <hi>to honour the Lord with their Subſtance, and with the Firſt-Fruits of their Increaſe.</hi> That is, They were in Gratitude to render back ſomthing of what he had beſtowed upon them. Not that he needs any thing of that which Men can return unto him; but that their Thankfulneſs may be expreſſed in what manner they are able to do it.</p>
                  <p>And this their Gratitude might be the greater, in that God ſecured his Gifts unto them by his Laws; allotting to every Tribe its proper Portion; and diſtributing that Portion amongſt the Heads of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Families: That Diſcords at firſt might not hinder their Poſſeſſions; and that Avarice and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition might not afterwards break into them. For what was thus divided by Lot (the Diſpoſal of which was wholly from God,) was not to be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to other Tribes, nor to other Families of the ſame Tribe. The Property of the Land remained firm; only the Uſe and Incomes of it might be ſold for a ſeaſon; which yet might at any time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; and if it were not redeemed, it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reverted to the ancient Owners at the Year of Jubile. And hereupon Induſtry was encouraged, and Peace eſtabliſhed; and they ſate under <hi>their</hi> (in a moſt proper ſenſe,) <hi>Own Vines and Fig-trees, none making them afraid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, God had not only beſtowed upon the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> all that they enjoyed; but even They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were alſo wholly from Him. In Kindneſſes from Men the Man is ſuppoſed to have a Being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And that we are Men, and have an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Soul, is not properly the Gift of any Man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49802:18"/> to us. But God hath (as I may ſo ſpeak,) given us Ourſelves as well as other things; and ſo our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to Him is to be ſo much higher than to others, by how much Life and Being are better than Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions: Yea, by how much what we enjoy are more his Gifts unto us, than they can be the Gifts of any others. For the Propriety of them is for ever his; and his Providence will never part with the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Direction of them. And therefore though others ſhould give them us, it is his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through their Hands.</p>
                  <p>How then might Thoſe in the Judaick State love the Laws, which have immediate Relation to God as a Lawgiver? How full of Reaſon are they? Is there not the greateſt Beauty in them? Which, could it be diſcern'd by our outward Eyes, who is it could ſee and not love them? And ſurely what appears truly beautiful to the Eye of the Soul (<hi>i. e.</hi> to clear and deliberate Thoughts,) will call no leſs for love, but much more: Intellectual Beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to be preferr'd before that which is Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>And if I may once more Paraphraſe this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it implyeth thus much. Nothing in the World is there that ſhall hinder me from loving it. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it before all other things, however eſteemed they be by Men. Were it left to my choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would have any of theſe Laws repealed; or whether I would fear, love, and be grateful unto God or not, though no Puniſhments ſhould be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if I did not do it, there ſhould not be one Law the leſs for my Duty towards my God and Lawgiver. Nor ſhould any thing, how pleaſant or advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoever it be, buy off my Obſervance of his Laws: So dear is their Practice, and ſo delightful their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation to me.</p>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee and acknowledge the Excellence of theſe Laws, and do really think them worthy the high Character which this Royal Perſon gave; and the great Love which he expreſſed to them.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> of thoſe Laws, which in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance had relation to God immediately, <hi>Some were ſuch as might ſeem to have no real Goodneſs in them, but Cruelty rather. E. G.</hi> The ſhedding ſo much Blood, of Men, in Circumciſion; of Beaſts, in Sacrifice. <hi>Others,</hi> though not Cruel, <hi>might</hi> yet <hi>ſeem to proceed</hi> (and are by many thought ſo to do,) <hi>from the Will of God as Supream, without any diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible Reaſon for their being enjoyn'd,</hi> and conſequently without any Love to his Creatures: For what Love can be ſeen there, where no Reaſon can be aſſigned, why ſuch and ſuch things are commanded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden? And who is it then that can love ſuch Laws? Of this ſort were thoſe that forbad <hi>the wearing of Linnen and Woollen in the ſame Garment;</hi> The <hi>Ploughing with an Ox and an Aſs together;</hi> And <hi>the uſe of ſuch and ſuch Creatures for Food;</hi> and others not unlike unto theſe.</p>
                  <p>And then further; <hi>The Laws, that require Fear, are ſuch as are enforced upon the account that God is Terrible;</hi> And where ſo great Terribleneſs is at the bottom of theſe Laws, how could they be ſo much loved? For (as the Apoſtle ſaith,) <hi>Perfect Love caſteth out Fear:</hi> And where Laws do require ſo much Fear, the Love to them muſt needs be the leſs.</p>
                  <p>Pray, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> tell me, <hi>Are theſe to be excepted</hi> from our Pſalmiſt's Love? Or if not, how can it be truly ſaid, he loved them?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>For the ſatisfying of you in theſe things; and firſt for your firſt Objection, (to wit, <hi>That of thoſe Laws which in their Obſervance had relation unto God immediately, ſome might ſeem to have no real Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49802:19"/> in them, but Cruelty rather;</hi> as the <hi>ſhedding</hi> ſo much <hi>Blood;</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and of <hi>Beaſts</hi> in <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>) it will not, I ſuppoſe, be unmeet that theſe things be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Law, which hath ſo much love here expreſſed to it, is (as I before hinted,) to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>Moral Law chiefly.</hi> For this hath a real and intrinſick Goodneſs in it. It is juſt and good that God, as he is our God and Lawgiver, ſhould be feared, loved, and have Gratitude ſhew'd to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to thoſe other Laws of Circumciſion and Sacrifices, though, in themſelves conſidered, they are not Morally good; yet, conſidered with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the good things which God was pleaſed to beſtow to the upright Obſervance of them; and with relation alſo to the more ſevere Commands which he juſtly might have laid upon Men; they have been <hi>comparatively good; i. e.</hi> they ſhewed forth the Favour and Kindneſs of God unto Men. And might they not then be loved for the far greater Severities that might have been enjoyn'd? and for the many and great Temporal Bleſſings, which Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them had brought as its Reward? Surely they might.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Significations and Effects, which theſe Laws had, were excellent.</p>
                  <p>Circumciſion was Inſtituted by God as a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Mark,</hi> by which the Jews <hi>were ſealed</hi> to be his People. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. it is called <hi>The Token of the Covenant betwixt God and Them;</hi> to the intent that He ſhould be their God, and They his People. And this poſſibly (as a Learned Perſon obſerves,) might be the reaſon, why God would have this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Mark or Sign to be impreſs'd upon them to their pain; and to be admitted and undergone with a kind of ſhamefacedneſs; <hi>viz.</hi> That Nature might
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49802:19"/> not ſeem to dictate it; nor meerly the Commands of Men to enjoyn it; but that it might be owned to proceed from God; who by ſuch an unthought-of Mark among Men, would ſeal that People unto himſelf. And though Circumciſion, by ſome of the Seed of <hi>Abraham, (Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Ketura,</hi>) was introduced into ſome other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afterward, yet this hindred not the true Stock of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and their Poſterity, to be Marked for God's Peculiar. Inſomuch, that, by way of reproach, they called the Nations round about them, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed;</hi> and were back again themſelves, through Hatred and Deriſion, termed <hi>Verpi, Curti,</hi> and <hi>Recutiti,</hi> the <hi>Circumciſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither was Circumciſion deſtitute of ſomthing that might ſignifie <hi>Him</hi> to be <hi>holy and good</hi> from whom it came. It denoted a Purity and Cleanneſs to thoſe who bore it. Therefore it is ſaid <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>The Lord thy God will Circumciſe thine Heart, and the Heart of thy Seed to Love the Lord thy God.</hi> Of which import of the word, that Inſtance <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.23. is an unqueſtionable proof: <hi>When ye come into the Land, ye ſhall count the Fruit thereof as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. Three years ſhall it be as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; it ſhall not be eaten of; but in the fourth year, all the Fruit thereof ſhall be Holy, to praiſe the Lord withal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And might it not alſo, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Circumciſion, that it was ſo appoſitely ordered by God for the <hi>continual bringing to their Memory the Promiſe</hi> which he made unto <hi>Abraham?</hi> Now, that Promiſe was concerning his Seed: Which Seed, in the chief Acceptation, is to be underſtood of Chriſt; who is therefore, in Holy Scripture, called the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seed.</hi> Of this Promiſe Circumciſion was a Seal; and might be juſtly thought to be made on <hi>That part of the Body;</hi> that, as oft as they did Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49802:20"/> their Children, they might be <hi>put in Mind</hi> of Him, who, as to the Fleſh, was to come from the Loyns of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, though Circumciſion, in itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, might ſeem to carry very little of Mercy and Goodneſs in it, but the contrary rather; yet, as it thus entitled them the Peculiar People of God; directed them to an internal Purity; and betokened That Seed, in which They and all the Nations on Earth ſhould be bleſſed, it might juſtly have a great Expreſſion of their Love.</p>
                  <p>Look we in the next place upon Sacrifices. I will not here enquire into their firſt Riſe; whether Men began them of their own accord, and God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward improved them unto Myſterious Ends: Or, whether they primarily ſprung from a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, with immediate reſpect to thoſe Ends. It is enough to our preſent purpoſe to ſay, That ſome of them, under <hi>Moſes,</hi> did import <hi>a great Friendſhip and Familiarity from</hi> God unto Man; and the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſe,</hi> as it were, with them on Earth. Thus the Altar was his Table; and what was offered thereon was as his Meat. And other things in the Tabernacle firſt, and afterwards in the Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened a Dwelling-Houſe: As Spoons, Bowls, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, a Candleſtick and its Lamps; and ſuch-like.</p>
                  <p>Some other of theſe Sacrifices were, in many caſes, <hi>An Expiation for Sins againſt God:</hi> And, by the Blood of the Beaſt thus ſlain, the Life of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender was ſpared. For the Law, according to the ſtricteſt Sanction, maketh Death the Puniſhment of even the leaſt Diſobedience; as that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. doth ſhew. And this Blood of Bulls and Goats, was, by the Will and Mercy of the Lawgiver, ſo far a Real Expiation for theſe Sins, as that it did, in the Apoſtle's words, <hi>Sanctifie to the purifying of the Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49802:20"/>
                  <p>But then yet further; Theſe Sacrifices were <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical</hi> alſo, and did prefigure the pretious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which was to be a more Noble Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sins of the World; even thoſe Sins, for which there were allowed no Sacrifices under the Law; and this, not only to the purifying of the Fleſh, but to the purging of the Conſcience from Dead Works, to ſerve the Living God. And although we may think, that this was not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood generally by the Jews, who expected a <hi>Meſſias</hi> that ſhould be a Glorious Prince upon Earth; yet that it was, in great meaſure, underſtood by ſome more eminently Religious among them, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by our Pſalmiſt, who hath many Propheſies tending this way, and applied, by the Holy Ghoſt, in the New Teſtament, to this very thing, we have no reaſon to doubt. And ſo, though the ſhedding of Blood in Sacrifice might ſeem to have nothing of good in it, (and indeed God himſelf is ſaid <hi>not to delight in the Blood of Bullocks and Lambs;</hi> which he could not be ſaid to do, had it any Eſſential Moral Goodneſs in it,) yet as theſe Sacrifices betokened God's Dwelling among them; and by their being ſlain, the Lives of Men were ſpared; and alſo his Blood preſignified which ſhould be ſhed for the Sins of the World, it might well have this Expreſſion, <hi>O, how I love thy Law!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither let the ſhedding of Blood be Objected by any, as <hi>a want of Mercy</hi> in theſe Laws to thoſe <hi>Brutal Creatures,</hi> whoſe Blood they required to be ſhed; and diſagreeing to that Title which in Holy Writ is given unto God; to wit, <hi>The Preſerver of Beaſt as well as of Man.</hi> There are, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who, by all means, will have theſe Creatures to be meer <hi>Machins,</hi> altogether deſtitute of Senſe. And, were it thus, there would, in reality, be no occaſion to move any queſtion concerning theſe Laws, in this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49802:21"/> reſpect. But till Men are convinced that Brutes are thus inſenſible, and that, notwithſtanding all the ſigns of pain when they are wounded, there yet really is no pain to them, (which will never be generally believed; and none can be blamed if it be not,) this conceit will, in the preſent caſe, ſtand in no ſtead at all. Nay, the falſeneſs of it, may, from what we but now ſaid, be fully evidenced; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Blood of the Beaſt, as <hi>being his Life,</hi> was to go for the Life of the Offender, (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Remiſſion without Blood, <hi>which is the Life,</hi>) and alſo, that thereby <hi>the Death of Chriſt</hi> was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified; a Nobler Expiation than the <hi>Death of Bulls and Goats;</hi> neither of which could fairly be ſaid, were there no real Death to the Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>But laying aſide ſuch an uncouth and extravagant Imagination, we may with Sobriety, and on good Grounds, affirm; That God, who made the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, might, without infringing his Goodneſs, command what he pleaſed concerning them; for they were his Property. And if he indulged unto Men ſuch variety of them to be ſlain for their Food, he might ſurely be allowed ſome ſorts of them to be ſlain for his own Worſhip. Eſpecially, ſince this way, through his infinite Goodneſs, they were more uſeful to Mans Welfare, than either while they were killed for Food, or kept alive for Service. In other caſes God had taken care by his Laws for Mercy to be ſhew'd to them: And while they were ſlaughter'd for ſuch excellent Ends, and made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the doing ſuch ſignal Services both to the Glory of God, and the Good of Men, the pain they ſuffer'd laid a great Honour upon them, though they were below the Capacity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it. Yea further; ſo far merciful were theſe Laws to theſe Creatures, that only the Blood of ſuch was called for, as would otherwiſe poſſibly,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49802:21"/> ſome time or other, have been killed for Mens uſe. And herein they were favourable to <hi>Men</hi> likewiſe; in that they required not ſuch Sacrifices as, for rareneſs, ſhould be far and wide ſought after; nor ſuch as by their fierceneſs might endanger thoſe that caught them; But home-bred and quiet Oxen and Sheep; innocent, and not rare, Turtle-Doves and Pidgeons were thoſe which God was pleaſed to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Himſelf.</p>

                  <p>You have taken away my Scruples as to thoſe Laws which might ſeem to carry ſomething of Cruelty in them: I deſire you would do the like for me in relation to thoſe Laws, which, though not Cruel, did <hi>ſeem to proceed from the Will of God as he is Supream;</hi> without <hi>any diſcernable Reaſon for their being enjoyn'd;</hi> and conſequently without any Love to his Creatures: For Love is to be found only in thoſe Laws, where good Reaſon can be given why ſuch and ſuch things are commanded or forbidden: And only <hi>thoſe Laws</hi> are worthy to <hi>be loved</hi> by Men.</p>

                  <p>But that He, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who is infinitely Wiſe, did give Laws without Reaſon; and exerted his Will, as he was Supream, with no reſpect to his Wiſdom, there is none, ſure, can, with any ſhew of Reaſon or Wiſdom, imagine. And though We, who are at ſuch a diſtance from the Jewiſh Times, cannot preſently find why God enjoyn'd ſuch and ſuch things, it will yet be raſh to ſay, that thoſe who lived near the Days when theſe Laws were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, were ignorant of the Reaſons for which they were given.</p>
                  <p>If ſome of theſe Laws were made directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the vain Cuſtoms of the Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, eſpecially of the <hi>Zabii;</hi> and did ſecure the Iſraelites from the Superſtitions and Idolatries which thoſe were guilty of, it was a good Reaſon why
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49802:22"/> they were enjoyn'd. And this ſeems to have been done, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.2, 3. <hi>After the Doings of the Land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, ſhall ye not do; and after the Doings of the Land of Canaan, whither I bring you, ſhall ye not do: Ye ſhall do MY Judgments, and keep MINE Ordinances;</hi> to wit, as being flatly oppoſite to the Rites and Cuſtoms of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan.</hi> And though ſome of thoſe things were neither good nor ill in themſelves; yet, either as they were uſed amiſs by thoſe Nations, or might open a Door to worſe things in the Iſraelites, God, who had eſpouſed this People to Himſelf as to an Husband, might take away all Occaſions that might tempt them to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs towards him: And therefore gave theſe Laws unto them. Neither is it altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that, in many of theſe Laws, there was a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Senſe, which among ſome other Reaſons might have a place for one. For why might not Simplicity in Manners, and a Freedom from Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Religion, be ſignified by not ploughing with an Ox and an Aſs together; and not wearing Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and Linnen in the ſame Veſture? And in ſome of thoſe Creatures prohibited for Food, why might there not be a Caution againſt thoſe Human Vices which ſeemed to be Character'd in them? As Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity in the Hare; Filthineſs in the Swine; Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the Owl; Rapine in the Hawk, and ſuch like. It doth not follow, becauſe we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the like manner, in all the reſt of thoſe Creatures which are forbidden, that there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Ground for ſuch Reaſon in thoſe we have mention'd. And though the People of the Jews were very dull and carnal, yet that they was ſo dull and carnal as not to diſcern ſuch a meaning in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions; and that therefore there were no ſuch meaning in the Prohibitions, is ſomthing ſtrange to aſſert.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49802:22"/>
                  <p>Beſides, God poſſibly might, in ſome of theſe Laws, not give a Reaſon, that they might the more ſurely be obſerved. For ſomtimes when the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Laws is known, ſome Men are apt to think, that if they can obtain the End without keeping the Law, it is no matter if they break it. And this, one well repreſents in the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.17. <hi>He ſhall not multiply Wives, that his Heart turn not away:</hi> But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, I will multiply Wives, and mine Heart ſhall not be turned away. But it is written afterwards, <hi>That his Wives turn'd away his Heart.</hi> God will not therefore, in ſome of his Laws, give an open Reaſon for their being enjoyn'd, becauſe Men may thereby reſign up their Underſtandings to Him, and not fruſtrate his Commands by ways of their own. And yet this may with Truth be ſaid, That <hi>Thoſe Laws,</hi> for which there is no particular Reaſon given, and which, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered, do include no real Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God did, in great meaſure, order <hi>for the better promoting of Obedience in general</hi> to thoſe Laws, which are in their own Nature truly good, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently include Reaſons for their being obſerved. And this He did <hi>by ſuting thoſe ſubordinate Laws,</hi> in many Things, <hi>to the Temper</hi> of that People, and the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Climate</hi> in which they lived: Who, had they not been continually enured to Obedience in theſe ſmaller things, would have been diſobedient in thoſe which were greater.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and ſome of theſe Laws of which no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain account can be given, might be fitted for their Temper another way alſo. It hath been noted, that as the Jews, and ſome other Eaſtern Nations, were more than ordinary inclined to the Leproſie, ſo the eating of Swines Fleſh did much increaſe it. And if, in this Inſtance, God was their Phyſician as well as Lawgiver, by making their Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49802:23"/> to their Health, it will not be unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to think that, in ſome other things of the like Rank, he might be ſo too. In the Commands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diſeaſe but now mentioned, it may ſeem he was. For it is hard to give any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a Perſon, whoſe Fleſh is cover'd all over with the Leproſie, ſhould be <hi>pronounced clean,</hi> and another, who had any <hi>raw, or live-fleſh not overſpread with it,</hi> ſhould be <hi>unclean, (Levit.</hi> 13.12.) unleſs it were that the power of infection had ceaſed in the former, and did continue in the later.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> but our Pſalmiſt and holy Men under <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaw more things belonging to theſe Laws, than any now adays are able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in. But theſe may take off the force of what you urged againſt them, as to their want of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and, in that reſpect, as to their want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.</p>

                  <p>If I forget not, it was this: That the <hi>Precepts, which require Fear,</hi> are ſuch as are <hi>enforced upon the account tbat God is Terrible;</hi> and where ſo great Terribleneſs is at the bottom of theſe Laws, the Love to them muſt needs be the Ieſs: <hi>For perfect Love caſteth out Fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs that God, in the Old Teſtament, did often manifeſt himſelf in ſuch a manner as might throw a <hi>Terrour</hi> into Men: And even at the giving of the Law in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> there were <hi>Thundrings and Lightnings, and the Noiſe of the Trumpet, and the Mountain ſmoaking.</hi> All which might ſtrike a <hi>Terrour;</hi> and did ſtrike ſo great an one into the People, that they deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>ſpeak unto them, and they would hear; but ſhould God ſpeak unto them, they ſhould die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49802:23"/>
                  <p>But though this were ſo, yet we may truly ſay, That God choſe this way, by reaſon of the <hi>inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible Nature</hi> of the People, whom more mild and gentle Methods would not ſo well have prevail'd upon. How often, in Scripture, are they called <hi>A ſtiff-necked People?</hi> And therefore they were to be <hi>trained under the Law as under a School-maſter;</hi> not being as yet fit for the higheſt things, but, as it were, in the loweſt Form. Their Duty of Fearing God they are to be excited unto by Means that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented God Terrible, or they would not have feared him at all.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon thoſe that knew the great Love of God to his People, (who, rather than <hi>He</hi> would loſe <hi>Them,</hi> or <hi>They</hi> ſhould caſt <hi>Him</hi> off, would uſe the more ſevere Methods for the keeping them in their Duty, and the fitting them for his Favour,) might well love the Law that enjoyn'd the Fearing of God, and the way alſo that enforced it.</p>
                  <p>But yet the Methods which ſtruck ſuch Terrour, God was pleaſed to uſe only upon ſome ſpecial Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; and he often, if not always, intermixed with them Means which were more gentle; that this Fear might not be the Fear of a Slave or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his Tyrant, but of a Subject to his Prince; who looks after thoſe under him with Care and Love, though he ſometimes injects a Dread into them by his Majeſty. And this is very remarkable even in the giving of the Law, when, as we ſaid, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his Terrours. The Preface to the Decalogue remembers the Iſraelites of his great Kindneſſes to them; <hi>I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the Houſe of Bondage.</hi> And in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, his <hi>viſiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of thoſe that hate him,</hi> is abundantly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49802:24"/> by <hi>his ſhewing Mercy unto thouſands in them that love him, and keep his Commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some indeed there have been, who have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of any Prologue to be put before Laws, or any perſuaſives to be mingled with them; it being the part of a Lawgiver by Authority to Command, and not by arguments to perſuade. But though God hath more Power than all other Lawgivers; and hath a Will infinitely more perfect than theirs; and conſequently might give his Laws in the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory manner; yet he was pleaſed to make way for them into the Hearts of his People, by Love as well as Fear; that as the careleſs might be affrighted, ſo the more ingenuous might be allured; and none kept back from Obedience, either by preſumption or diſcouragement. I might inſtance in many places of Scripture pertinent hereunto; but I will do it only in two, where God is ſaid to be Terrible. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>The Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, a Mighty and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God;</hi> But then the very next words are; <hi>He doth execute the Judgment of the Fatherleſs and the Widow,</hi> and <hi>loveth the Stranger in giving him Food and Raiment.</hi> The other place is in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 1.5. <hi>O Lord of Heaven, the great and TERRIBLE God, that keepeth COVENANT and MERCY to them that Love him, and obſerve his Commandments.</hi> How is his Terribleneſs here mitigated, yea, ſet off, and made Lovely by his Goodneſs and Mercy? And what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Comment can we give of theſe Scriptures, (and many others not unlike them,) than that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>There is Mercy with Thee, that thou mayeſt be Feared.</hi> Though there hath been a <hi>Strong Wind</hi> that rent the Mountains, and brake in pieces the Rocks; though an <hi>Earthquake</hi> there were, and after that a <hi>Fire,</hi> yet God was not ſo much in any of theſe; or, at leaſt, delighted not ſo much to be in theſe, as in the <hi>ſtill ſmall Voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49802:24"/>
                  <p>And this, I think, may be ſufficient for your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and alſo for the Laws which require Duties to God as a Prince and Lawgiver. Better Laws, and better grounds for their obſervance, could not be wiſh'd; and ſo they might well be Loved.</p>

                  <p>Pray, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> proceed to thoſe <hi>Laws, which require Duties from Men, one to another.</hi> Which, I well remember, you would have to be conſidered in the next place, to thoſe Laws which reſpected the Duties to God immediately.</p>

                  <p>For the <hi>wellfare of Society,</hi> a Rational Man would deſire, that there ſhould be <hi>Honour and Reſpect</hi> ſhew'd unto Superiours, by thoſe that are <hi>below them;</hi> and that there ſhould not be oppreſſion and ill nature towards Inferiours, from thoſe that are <hi>above them;</hi> but that Righteouſneſs and Kindneſs ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed unto all.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe excellent things are all ſtrictly enjoyn'd by Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>The Duty of Honour and Reſpect to Superiours, the Fifth Command ſufficiently requires. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother; i. e.</hi> all thoſe who being in Place or Authority above thee, are, in a larger Senſe, Fathers and Mothers. And ſince Authority and Dignity were firſt ſeated in, and did ariſe from, that which was Paternal, I ſuppoſe that therefore Father and Mother are put for all Superiours.</p>
                  <p>And, under the Word Honour, are compriſed all thoſe Duties, which, in any Circumſtances, are, in right Reaſon, to be ſhewn from meaner Perſons to thoſe that are above them; which Circumſtances may, upon occaſion, be better conceived, than here, at the preſent, diſcourſed of.</p>
                  <p>For Superiours not oppreſſing thoſe who are Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, by uſing their Power to the depriving them of what is theirs, the Tenth Commandment is, by a juſt conſequence, a ſtrong Law. They are therein
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49802:25"/> 
                     <hi>forbid to Covet any thing;</hi> much leſs then are they to take by force that which is their Neighbours; and the meaner ſort, ſurely, may bear the Name of Neighbour to thoſe who are higher.</p>
                  <p>But there is an expreſs Precept, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.17. <hi>You ſhall not oppreſs one another; no not a Stranger;</hi> Chap. 22.17. <hi>No nor a Servant that is eſcaped from an hard Maſter;</hi> Deut. 23.16. <hi>Nor ſhut thine Hand from him; nor thine Eye againſt him,</hi> Chap. 15.7.9.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Excellent Laws were made for <hi>good Deeds</hi> to be done unto them. <hi>The Corners of the Field were not to be fully Reaped;</hi> nor <hi>the Gleanings of the Vintage to be gathered, but left for them,</hi> Levit. 18. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>grew every Seventh year</hi> was not to be inned; and <hi>a Releaſe was alſo then to be made of all Debts,</hi> i. e. of all Debts owing by the Poor to the Rich. And leſt a Man ſhould, from the thoughts of this years Releaſe, be the more ſtrait-handed to his poor Brother, there is is a ſpecial caution given in this point, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. <hi>Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked Heart, ſaying, the Seventh year, the year of Releaſe is at hand, and thine Eye be evil againſt thy poor Brother, thou ſhalt ſurely give him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, at the <hi>year of Jubile,</hi> (which was every Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year,) there was an Univerſal Freedom and Joy, every Man might return to his Poſſeſſion; and every Servant to his own Family. Yea, this year, as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the greateſt Mercy and Gladneſs when it came, ſo it ſtretched forth Righteouſneſs and Mercy to all other the years. For thus it is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. <hi>According to the number of years after the Jubile, thou ſhalt buy of thy Neighbour; and according to the number of the Fruits he ſhall ſell unto thee; according to the multitude of years, thou ſhalt encreaſe the price thereof; and according to the fewneſs of years, thou ſhalt diminiſh the price thereof; ye ſhall not therefore oppreſs one another; but thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49802:25"/>
                  <p>And then, in general, all Perſons were upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew Love and Kindneſſes, and to have them ſhew'd back again to themſelves. And by ſuch Acts as theſe; as alſo by the abſtaining from Adulteries, Thefts, Falſe-Teſtimonies, and ſuch like ill Actions, Society was to be kept up, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Peace maintain'd.</p>
                  <p>It is, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> delightful to conſider, how by Laws, even towards Beaſts, Birds, and Trees, God minded his People of a kind and good deportment one towards another. <hi>The Ewe and her Lamb were not to killed both in one day,</hi> Levit 22.28. Neither was <hi>the Old Bird to be taken with her Eggs or Young,</hi> but <hi>in any wiſe to be let go; that it might be well with them,</hi> Deut. 22.6. Such ſeeming Cruelty muſt not be committed as <hi>to ſeethe a Kid in its Mothers Milk,</hi> Exod. 23.19. And the <hi>Fruit-Trees</hi> (though in a Siege againſt an Enemy) <hi>muſt not be cut down,</hi> but ſpared; and this, out of a kind of Gratitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bring forth for the Life of Man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.19. So every way do theſe Laws tend to the planting of good Nature and ſociable Virtues. And, ſurely, ſuch Laws as theſe might well have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Love towards them. Conſider, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> a Commonwealth well govern'd, (as That of the Jews was,) and all Happineſs accruing unto it, (as to That there did,) and tell me, if thoſe Laws be not worthy to be loved.</p>
                  <p>One Law indeed there was which the Jews after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards complain'd of, as bringing them into great Straits and Troubles, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>which commanded their Ground not to be Tilled,</hi> and <hi>their Increaſe not to be gathered by the Owners every ſeventh year.</hi> For ſince Pecuniary Tributs were exacted of them, and their Field-encreaſes were the Foundation of their Coin, they found themſelves, when their Crops were not brought home, to be, in great meaſure, diſabled
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49802:26"/> for the anſwering ſuch Taxations. And therefore when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had learnt out of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Propheſie that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire ſhould be overthrown by a Man that was a <hi>Greek,</hi> and thereupon, as perſuaded that Himſelf was the Perſon, had bid the <hi>Jews</hi> ask of him ſome great Boon, they ſignified to him that a greater Privilege could not be granted them, than the being freed from the ſeventh years Tribute; which Requeſt they obtain'd of him.</p>
                  <p>But though this Law proved heavy to them, yet it was not from any defect in the Inſtitution, but from their Sins; By theſe they forfeited God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and gave him cauſe to turn that Law into their Puniſhment, which he firſt made for the exerciſe of Mercy among themſelves, and for the manifeſting of his own Power and Goodneſs towards them. For thus we find it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.20, 21, 22. <hi>If ye ſhall ſay, What ſhall we eat the ſeventh year? behold, we ſhall not ſow, nor gather in our encreaſe; then I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Bleſſing upon you in the ſixth year, and it ſhall bring forth fruit for three years. And ye ſhall ſow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit the ninth year; until her fruits come in, ye ſhall eat of the old ſtore.</hi> If their Land fail'd of its Fertility, <hi>A fruitful Land was turn'd into Barrenneſs for the Wickedneſs of them that dwelt therein:</hi> According as it was expreſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.20. <hi>If you will not hearken unto me, your Land ſhall not yield her Increaſe, nor the Trees their Fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Laws which reſpected the Jews from one another.</p>
                  <p>As to the Laws which related to <hi>Themſelves</hi> in their own Perſons, I will ſay only this, (and it is enough to ſhew an amiable Excellence in them,) <hi>viz.</hi> That they are ſuch as make a Man calm in his Breaſt, and ſtrong in his Body. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49802:26"/> as thy ſelf,</hi> ſuppoſeth that a Man is to love Himſelf; and the Suppoſition is built upon, and is as valid as a Law: A more benign Law than which what Man <hi>is it</hi> can deſire? He is hereby not to torture himſelf by Anxious Cares and Envious Thoughts. He is engaged likewiſe not to impair his Health by any manner of Exceſs; for, in doing either the one or the other, he would not be his own Friend, nor love himſelf. And this hath an excellent tendency to Friendſhip abroad alſo. He, who loves himſelf ſo well as not to envy others, will by others not be envied but loved. And He, who for his own Welfare will be temperate and ſober, is rightly fitted for the being faithful, and for the having Truſt repoſed in him.</p>
                  <p>And thus, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> we have briefly run through theſe Laws. And if you conſider them as to the <hi>Moral part,</hi> they naturally tend to the eſtabliſhing of a People in Peace and Proſperity: And may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſervedly be loved. And if you conſider them <hi>altogether,</hi> they had ſome things from <hi>without,</hi> that might preſerve Mens Love towards them from growing Faint, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods eſpecial promiſe of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rewards, and his immediate Protection. <hi>If thou ſhalt hearken unto the Voice of the Lord, to obſerve and do all his Commandments, the Lord ſhall command the bleſſing upon thee in thy Store Houſes, and in all that thou ſetteſt thy Hand unto: And he ſhall bleſs thee in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. He ſhall give thee Rain in due ſeaſon to multiply thy Corn, and thy Wine; ſo much that the Threſhing ſhall reach unto the Vintage; and the Vintage reach unto the Ploughing; and thou ſhalt dwell ſafely in thy Land:</hi> And ſo ſignal was this ſafety which they enjoyed, that when, for the Worſhipping of God, all the Males were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to repair to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though their Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were left Naked, and defenceleſs, yet never
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49802:27"/> did their Enemies take that opportunity either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, or any way moleſt them: According to that Word of <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24. <hi>Neither ſhall any man deſire thy Land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And leſt their Love to theſe Laws ſhould, from Earthly Proſperity, <hi>ſink into Careleſneſs,</hi> (as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bleſſings make oftentimes even that Obedience to be forgotten, for which they were ſent as a Reward,) it was kept awake, and taught to be Reverential by ſome miraculous things which attended theſe Laws. Such were the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim</hi> on the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of the High-Prieſt; which, when conſulted by meet Perſons, on weighty concerns, did by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful power afford anſwers: <hi>The Ark of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> from which Oracles were given by an audible Voice. <hi>The Sacred Fire of the Altar,</hi> which falling, as it were, like a Lion on the Sacrifices, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumed them. <hi>The appearance of a Cloud</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the Tabernacle, and afterward on the Temple; to which we may add the <hi>open and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects of Gods Power</hi> manifeſt in Battles; and in particular Revenges from Heaven upon preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sinners. God would not have done ſo wondrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in relation to his Laws, had they not been of very high account with him, and this might well keep up Life and Vigour in Conſidering and Devout Mens Love towards them.</p>
                  <p>I have, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> in my ſpeaking to theſe Laws, asked of you, what, in Right Reaſon, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a perfect Harmony of Things, you would have the Duties towards a Prince and Lawgiver to be. And I have ventured to ſay, that a Rational Man, for the Welfare of Society, would wiſh for ſuch and ſuch Laws. And this I think I might well do, without offering any injury to theſe Laws, by making Human Reaſon to be the Judge of them.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49802:27"/> For they are rightly agreeable to our Nature, and the true Sentiments thereof. But though they are ſo, and by all muſt be acknowledg'd ſo to be, yet no Nation on Earth was ſo happy as to have them ſo eſtabliſhed as the Jews had. Hereupon it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Keep ye theſe Statutes, and do theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this is your Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the ſight of the Nations, which ſhall hear all theſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Surely this great Nation is a Wiſe and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding People, for what Nation is there ſo great, which hath Statutes and Judgments ſo Righteous as all this Law which I ſet before you this Day?</hi> And very obſervable it is, as to what I have been ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> That in times of Captivity, when the Laws of the Conquer'd are uſually changed, if not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Conquerours, theſe Laws found ſuch favour abroad, that they were never as to any part of them alter'd. And that the Jewiſh Nation lived to ſee the Periods of three noted Monarchies ſucceeding one another; and, in an uninterrupted Line, did itſelf continue ſtill the ſame; flouriſhing and happy, unleſs when careleſs and diſobedient; cannot be aſcribed to any thing but the Excellency of theſe Laws, and Gods more than ordinary Bleſſing attending them.</p>
                  <p>All which things, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> being rightly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may ſhew forth the <hi>Madneſs</hi> of <hi>Marcion,</hi> and ſome others of the Gnoſtick Crew, who impiouſly pronounced the <hi>God of the Old Teſtamrnt</hi> to be an <hi>Evil One, Moroſe</hi> and <hi>Cruel,</hi> and of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture quite from <hi>him</hi> to whom the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> belongeth. Although greater Love is diſplay'd by <hi>Chriſt</hi> than under <hi>Moſes</hi> could be diſcern'd, yet that the Old Law proceeded from a <hi>Good God,</hi> who was <hi>Merciful and Gracious,</hi> and who made thoſe his Laws ſuitable to the Jewiſh Nation, and pertinently ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant of better things to come, <hi>all</hi> certainly, who will be righteous and conſiderate in their Thoughts,

                  <p>But ſince all theſe Laws (whether relating to God or Men,) are ſo Excellent, and ſo Worthy to be Loved, Why doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> call them <hi>the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Death?</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. And why doth he ſay, <hi>he was alive without the Law once; but when the Commandment came, Sin Revived and he Dyed?</hi> Rom. 7.9. as if he were the worſe for the Law; and might date his Death from it.

                  <p>In anſwer to your firſt Scripture, wherein the Law is called <hi>the Miniſtration of Death;</hi> ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it thus; not as if the Law brought no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges with it, or rather Death; but ſo, as that all the promiſes, which were made to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Law, were ſuch as had relation <hi>to this Life only;</hi> and were all terminated in Death. And therefore, it is obſerved, that the Word <hi>Life,</hi> in all the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is never taken otherwiſe then for this Temporal Life: And all the rewards are mention'd only under the Name of Temporal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as may be ſeen in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and other places. Not (ſaith a Worthy Man of our own,) but that Eternal Rewards were in good meaſure Revealed to ſome Excellent Perſons of Old; and the frequenter afterwards as the coming of Chriſt drew nearer; but theſe Revelations though vouchſafed by God, under the Law, did not properly belong to the Law; and, in ſtrictneſs of Speaking, were not of it. It might therefore be well called <hi>the Miniſtration of Death,</hi> in caſe the Rewards belonging unto it had thus an end, and did ceaſe in Death.</p>
                  <p>However the Law might juſtly have this Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe, (as I before mentioned,) in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Sanction of it, <hi>Death</hi> was the Puniſhment of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49802:28"/> Diſobedience. <hi>Curſed is every one, that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> And though God was pleaſed to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate this Severity, in allowing Sacrifices to be an Expiation for ſome Sins, yet the great Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Law, how repentant ſoever the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters might be, found no ſuch favour. Only leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Offences, and ſuch as proceeded from Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence rather than Deſign, were thoſe for which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were indulg'd: Whilſt, <hi>the Souls that did ought preſumptuouſly, whether Strangers, or born in the Land, were to be cut off from among the People,</hi> Numb. 15.30, 31. Which (as it may ſeem,) made <hi>David</hi> himſelf afterwards (with reſpect to his Adultery and Murther,) to ſay, <hi>Thou deſireſt not Sacrifice, elſe would I give it,</hi> Pſal. 51. There not being any Sacrifices provided for ſuch Sins. And hereupon the Law is called <hi>The Miniſtration of Death;</hi> when yet to thoſe that were Obedient, the Priviledges it gave were many; and ſo, for thoſe, as for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, which, in itſelf, it had, might be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>That other Scripture, to wit, <hi>I was alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law once; but when the Commandment came Sin revived, and I died:</hi> We (if we take it as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Perſon of the Apoſtle, and not rather, by a Figure, for others,) are not ſo to underſtand it, as if he were the worſe for the Law, and might date his Death from it; But thus, While he look'd upon himſelf, and his own Actions, without a due Examination of them, according to the exactneſs of the Law, he might think himſelf to be in very good plight, and free from danger. But when he compared his Actions and Performances with the exceeding Accurateneſs of the Law, the Actions, which before look'd well, appear'd ſinful; and he ſaw his Danger and Demerits to be very great.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49802:29"/> Whereas <hi>the Law in itſelf was holy; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment holy, and juſt, and good,</hi> and ſo, for its own worth, might be loved.</p>
                  <p>Your laſt Scripture is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick</hi> Law is termed <hi>A Yoke, which neither We nor our Fathers were able to bear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this it may be replyed; That we are not to take theſe words in a ſtrict ſenſe, as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Jews could not bear that Yoke, but thus, They could not bear it without difficulty. For we know that they had born it, for many Generations, from the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> to that day.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Neither was it a Yoke abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. For God, in the giving of theſe Laws, did (as a great Man interprets it,) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.18. bear with ſome of their Manners, which the uſe of thoſe Times had taught them; and made his Sanctions ſuitable, in many things, to their being <hi>under-age,</hi> as it were, and too weak, as yet, for more perfect Inſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>But it is therefore term'd <hi>A Yoke,</hi> with reference to that Freedom, and thoſe very great Priviledges which are brought unto us by Chriſt. In Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Theſe, it is little better than a Bondage: When yet before, it was a great <hi>Honour</hi> to the Jews; and ſuch as <hi>They</hi> only had a ſhare in: The Heathens, as they were Heathens, having nothing to do in it.</p>
                  <p>You have, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> what at preſent I think may be replyed to the Scriptures you brought. Your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could, poſſibly, to your own Satisfaction, better have anſwered them: But if you are any way plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with what I have ſaid, and can reap though but the leaſt of that Spiritual Advantage, you, in the beginning of our Diſcourſe, ſpake of, I ſhall be the leſs ſolicitous for the excuſing of my Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures.</p>

                  <p>THE Inducements that Chriſtians have to Love the Divine Law. Love was the moving cauſe of our Lords becoming our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. The Greatneſs of our Lawgivers Perſon. All the troubleſome Ceremonies of the Old Law are done away by the Laws of our Lord; and this, not by his Will alone, but by the admirable manifeſtation of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom. How the Jews urging the Everlaſtingneſs of their Law is from hence anſwered; and how their way of Speaking is Corrected, when they ſay our Lawgiver hath vilified and deſtroy'd their Laws. Only ſuch Laws are enjoyn'd by our Lord, as have in them an Intrinſick Goodneſs, or elſe are for Ends abſolutely Good, and ſuch as are diſcernable by every one. Though the Jews had ſome Inferiour Laws ſuted to their Temper and Climate, which did the better fit them for the obſervance of thoſe Laws which were Moral, yet we have not the leſs reaſon to Love the Laws of our Lord becauſe they are all Good, without any mixture of ſuch Inferiour Laws,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49802:30"/> Laws, which may be agreeable to different Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates where Chriſtians Live, and which may promote the Precepts of our Lord, are not by thoſe Precepts excluded. Chriſtian Laws are ſuch alſo as will, in our Obedience, much comply with our particular Way and Temper. The Moral Laws which were given to the Jews, are by our Lord more fully and clearly given. The Laws that reſpect ourſelves are properly belonging to the New Teſtament: At leaſt, are there only directly and openly injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd. The Objection anſwer'd, that ſo far is the Chriſtian Law from being more clearly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it requires us to admit of ſome things relating to Faith, which no one living can conceive how they ſhould be. The Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of making our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings to yield to our Faith.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Inducements, that Chriſtians have for the Loving the Divine Law,</hi> (which are far greater than what the Jews had,) may, I preſume, be collected from the conſideration of theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Lawgiver; The Laws themſelves, and thoſe Motives which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto them, for the ſecuring of our Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the <hi>Lawgiver;</hi> it may very much contribute to the Love of the Chriſtian Law, That <hi>Love was the moving Cauſe of his becoming our Lawgiver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Puniſhment which Mankind, for the breach of the Command in Paradiſe, was from Gods Juſtice to ſuffer, the Son of God was willing, in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to undergo himſelf. And though God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he had ſo pleaſed might have refus'd that any ſhould bear the Puniſhment, beſides thoſe who had deſerv'd it, (for the Law, when it is Trangreſs'd, doth require that the Offenders ſhould ſuffer in their own Perſons, <hi>The Soul that Sinneth it ſhall dye,</hi>) yet he was pleaſed to accept of his Son in our ſtead. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the Reverence of his Laws, which, by the Sins of Mankind had been Violated, to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently maintain'd by his Death. But on this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only would God accept of his Son to dye in our Room, that the works of the Devil ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49802:31"/> in us; and that we (as was but meet for us to do,) ſhould endeavour after Holineſs of Life.</p>
                  <p>The Son of God therefore, that <hi>He</hi> might be our Propitiation, and that <hi>We</hi> might not be altogether unfit to whom ſo great Favours ſhould be ſhewn, cometh into the World to eſtabliſh and promote So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, Righteouſneſs, and Godlineſs among Men. It pitied him to ſee thoſe, whom he had Created in ſuch an Eminent Rank of Beings, to wander in Darkneſs; unable by all their Reaſonings to find out thoſe things that nearlieſt concern'd them; and recommending, upon uncertain grounds, thoſe that, in ſome faint meaſures, they did diſcern. He hereupon reduceth them into right Paths; giving them a true ſight of their wretched Eſtate; preſcribing an Exact Rule to live by; and ſettling it on a ſtrong and ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not only as agreeable to Mans Reaſon, which, though ſomtimes right, is often dim and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; but as ſuteable to the Goodneſs of God, which is abſolutely perfect; as being the Dictate of his Wiſdom, which cannot be deceived; The reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Will, which is moſt Holy; the Injunction of his Authority, which is moſt unqueſtionable; and the only way to a true and laſting Happineſs. Whence it is eaſie to diſcern, that in infinite Love he gives his Laws unto us. And the ſame Love, from which theſe Laws proceeded, did in an eminent manner confirm them, and teſtifie their being Divine. When he gave them, he aſcended into a Mount; and therein there was indeed ſome agreeableneſs betwixt the giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by Him. But this Mount did not <hi>burn with Fire;</hi> nor had <hi>it Blackneſs, and Darkneſs, and Tempeſt,</hi> as the other had, to keep the People at a diſtance from him. Neither were his Miracles of the ſeverer kind; as thoſe of Old, for the moſt part, were. He, by an Almighty Power, reſtored ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Life; but none ever ſuffered Death by him.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49802:31"/> He gave Health to more than a few; (for from him <hi>the Blind received their ſight, the Lame walked, the Lepers were cleanſed,</hi>) but he never hurt the Bodies of any, that it might well be ſaid, <hi>He went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good.</hi> But ſuch a ſweet-natured Eſtabliſhment of his Laws we the leſs may wonder at, as being no more than what might well be expected, when ſuch infinite and unſpeakable Love had brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to give Laws. A very great Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſure, for us to love thoſe Laws which were bottom'd on ſuch a tender Affection to Mankind.</p>

For is it poſſible, that any thing ſhould be more plainly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Holy Writ, than that Chriſt <hi>ſuffered for our Sins, the Juſt for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt?</hi> That he came to give his Life a <hi>Ranſom for many?</hi> That he is the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins;</hi> and that in due time he <hi>Died for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly?</hi> And can any thing be more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, than that our Lords dying in our ſtead was from his own Will? and was the act of one who had a Power to do what he did; and of one who could not ſink under the Puniſhment, and alſo an act which is conducive to the beſt Ends in the World, the illuſtrating of the infinite <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God in <hi>puniſhing Sin;</hi> of his infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> in <hi>ſaving Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> and of his <hi>unſpeakable Wiſdom</hi> in doing it in ſuch a way, which the Contrivances of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49802:32"/> could never have reached unto? And ſince God's Dominion is ſo much pleaded in this matter for the avoiding the Name of Puniſhment, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to be only Affliction, we may pertinently ask, Why by <hi>his Dominion</hi> he might not <hi>Puniſh</hi> an Innocent Perſon offering himſelf in the place of the Offenders, as well as throw <hi>Afflictions</hi> upon him, as great and acute as Puniſhment itſelf could be? And what difference is there to the Perſons Senſe who thus ſuffereth, betwixt Afflictions and Puniſhments? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Theſe Men are very ill Aſſerters of the Divine Juſtice, who, while they deny that God may puniſh the Innocent inſtead of the Guilty, though from ſuch admirable Motives but now mentioned, dare, at the ſame time, make him to have laid the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Croſs upon his beloved Son, without reſpect to any offence or fault in the leaſt. Which, how unworthy a thought of God is it? And how little are they Friends to the Sacred Laws, who thus deprive them of their great Ornament, the wonderful Love in which they were founded!</p>

                  <p>But leaving theſe Men (how Rational ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they would be thought,) <hi>cum ratione ſua inſanire,</hi> if you have any thing more to ſay of this our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, pray, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> do it.</p>

                  <p>This, I think, I may ſay truly; That the Old <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, and the Bleſſings accruing to the Jews thereby, were very much upon the Account of, and in order unto, our Lawgivers Coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World. And whoſoever, throughly inſtructed in Chriſtianity, will look into the Jewiſh State, and the Laws and Cuſtoms of it, will without much difficulty find, that they were, for the moſt part, Types and Repreſentations of him who was to come. And they did betoken, either the Excellency of his Perſon, or the Purity and Holineſs of his Laws, or the Way how he would be a Ranſom for us, or the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49802:32"/> bleſſed Liberty we ſhould have under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſomthing or other relating unto him was ſignified by them, as might eaſily be ſhewed from their Prieſthood, Sacrifices, Waſhings, Jubiles; from the Land to which they were brought; from the Perſon that brought them; from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Refuge, and ſuch like. VVhich things do ſhew forth the Greatneſs of our Lawgiver, (though, while on Earth He, for moſt Gracious Ends, was, in appearance, mean.) For what Man, ever before Him, was ſo Honour'd as to have the State and Government of a great Nation, for ſo long a time, to be formed as a Prophecy of Him? And though Greatneſs, as ſuch, is rather fitted to ſtrike a Reverence than to allure Affections, yet it may allure them, when Majeſty and Love are equally mingled; and when our Lawgiver is Primarily, not more ſo by his Greatneſs, than by his Tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore to magnifie the Goſpel and the Laws thereof, ſpeaks of them as given and declared by the <hi>Son of God; God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto our Fathers by the Prophets, hath, in theſe laſt days, ſpoken unto us by his SON, whom he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Heir of all things; by whom he made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2. As much as to ſay, He hath ſpoken to us in a more Eminent manner than ever yet he hath done unto any. And Chap. 2. he gives Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency to his Laws before the Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> upon the Account that <hi>THAT</hi> was <hi>ſpoken by Angels, THESE</hi> by <hi>the Lord.</hi> And by how much the greater the Perſon is that ſpeaks, ſuppoſing the things he ſpeaks are in themſelves Good, (as we ſhall ſhew that His abſolutely are,) by ſo much the more ſhould the things ſpoken have our Obſervance and Eſteem. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49802:33"/> ſaid the Voice out of the Cloud at the Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when our Lawgiver did far exceed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Brightneſs of his Face;</hi> and had <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, with <hi>Elias,</hi> Attendants upon him. He it is, that hath the note of Excellence by S. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 1.18. <hi>viz. Who is in the Boſom of his Father. i. e.</hi> Who, as neareſt unto him, knows his mind moſt of any; Above All, he is to be heard. He alone is the Man, in whom, ſaith God, <hi>I am well pleaſed,</hi>

                  <p>Such conſiderations of our Lawgiver may well excite our eſteem of his Laws; and we have great reaſon to Love them for the Givers Sake: Since ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Laws were ſo much Honour'd, from <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> as theſe were.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. In that thoſe Moral Laws which were given to the Jews, are by our Lord more fully and clearly given.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that from theſe Laws we have a fair way for a pardon of all Sins.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Eighth Day doth not now ſhew us the Blood of our Children; nor give us an occaſion to pity them, from the pains they endured, by a Knife or ſharp Stone. And how great theſe <hi>Pains</hi> were, and what the <hi>Soreneſs,</hi> may be collected from the Story of the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> whom <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were able to ſlay, Two Men, a whole City. Thoſe Numerous Waſhings, which, upon the Touching of Unclean Things, (and thoſe Unclean Things ſo many,) were to be performed, are now at an end. There is now no being polluted for many Days, or, until the Evening, ſeparated from the Company of others; neither need we for every Sin of Ignorance go with a Goat unto the Temple for Sacrifice: Which how many muſt they have been, ſince too apt we are unawares to fall into Sin? Yea, a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod is put to all thoſe Sacrifices, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually offered up.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things had indeed good Reaſons (as hath been ſaid,) for their being enjoyn'd to the Jews. But it muſt be confeſſed that, as to their Number and Nature, they were tedious and burdenſom.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, had God done them, or the more uneaſie part of them, away, by his <hi>Will</hi> only, without any viſible Effects of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in their being aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would have been a great Favour unto us.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49802:34"/> But that they All ſhould ceaſe, by <hi>being improved into greater Excellencies:</hi> That Circumciſion, as it mark'd the Jews for Gods People, ſhould be at an end, by <hi>all the Kingdoms of the World becoming the Kingdoms of the Lord:</hi> That, as it imported Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Chaſtneſs, it ſhould be raiſed into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Circumciſion of the Heart, and the daily cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off (as it were,) all impure and corrupt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: That as it was a ſign of the Promiſed Seed, it ſhould end in His Wonderfully being Born, who is the Everlaſting Perfection of it: That ſo many Alluſions and Sprinklings ſhould terminate in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cleanneſs of the Soul and Conſcience; ſo as that there ſhould be no further need of ſuch things to denote it: That extraordinary Sacrifices ſhould be finiſhed by the Lamb of God's offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once for all; appeaſing, by his pretious Blood, his Fathers Wrath; ſatisfying his Juſtice, and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away our Sins: That ordinary Sacrifices ſhould be no more, through our Bodies and Souls being preſented daily unto God a <hi>Living Sacrifice,</hi> an <hi>holy, acceptable, and rational Service:</hi> That all thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> ſhould in ſo admirable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be cancell'd, is an high Demonſtration of Gods Wiſdom, and the greateſt Expreſſion of his Love to us.

                  <p>Some Things being ſaid to be Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and for ever, denoteth only their Duration ſo long till their Nature cannot extend them to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther length.

                  <p>And not impertinent to what we are now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was their way of dividing the World into Two Ages; The one before the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the other after. The former they called <hi>one for ever,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the Law as given by <hi>Moſes</hi> was Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the word <hi>Everlaſting</hi> may import a Duration ſo long as the Nature thereof would well allow of, ſo long as till the <hi>great Jubile</hi> ſhould be; (for ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtyle the <hi>Advent</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 62.2, 3.) And an Ordinance for ever it was, as <hi>for ever</hi> had relation to the Firſt Age of the World: But was not to endure beyond what the Nature thereof would well permit: Not <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> as taking in the Age of the VVorld under the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly we may, in a manner, ſay, that the Law is not Vilified and Deſtroy'd by our Lord, any more, than a Houſe is, when, from being rough and imperfect, it is finiſhed with the greateſt Wiſdom, and Adorned with the moſt Rich Materials; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity being the Judaick Religion Heightned and Spiritualiz'd.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49802:35"/>
                  <p>Our Lawgiver himſelf ſaith, He <hi>came not to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Law and the Prophets:</hi> And his mentioning the Prophets together with the Law, ſeemeth unto me to be a good explication of what I am now Speaking.</p>
                  <p>We do not, nor can we think, that, when Divine Prophecies are come to paſs, they are vilified and deſtroy'd: Rather, ſay we, that they are compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that the Compleating them is the Honour and Crown of them.</p>
                  <p>If then our Lord hath not deſtroy'd, but by his Coming made good thoſe Prophecies which were of him; Why ſhould it be ſaid that he hath Deſtroyed the Ceremonial Law, rather than Fulfilled it? Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, when That Law was, in great meaſure, as a Type and Propheſie of Him.</p>
                  <p>It is not indeed any more to be ſo obſerved as to be reduced in Practice; becauſe He, whom it did Prefigure hath been Preſent, and Lived among Us; juſt as the expectation of a Prophecie ceaſeth when what was Predicted is come to paſs: But then it hath its uſe ſtill, as alſo the fulfilled Propheſie have; and we are to look both upon the one and the other, with a great deal of Reverence and Reſpect, As the Coming of our Bleſſed Lawgiver, and the Purity, and Spiritualneſs of his Government, have Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Compleated Them; ſo They do now ſtand as faithful and evident Witneſſes of the Truth of his Coming, and of the perfection of his Laws.</p>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>You hindred me not. To this therefore we ſay, That the Laws, which relate unto God, are all of a Refined Nature; requiring that his Worſhip be performed in Spirit and in Truth; and are ſuch as ſhew forth his Spiritualneſs, his Purity, his Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience; and other his Glorious Attributes.</p>
                  <p>While we are Commanded to approach unto him with our Hearts, and to have them clean, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt before him, the Law hath an <hi>inward goodneſs</hi> in it, in that it requires us to <hi>be Holy,</hi> as <hi>he, whom we ſerve, is Holy.</hi> And it nouriſheth in us right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God; that his Nature is not <hi>Groſs and Bodily;</hi> but that he is preſent with us, and is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>A thing which could not be ſaid of ſome of thoſe actions, which in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law had Relation to Gods immediate Service. For wherein could the Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Gods Nature be inferred from the Blood of Beaſts, and their Fleſh being offered up unto him? How, could we from theſe Rites, in themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, be inſtructed in the Holineſs, Goodneſs, and Mercy of God? Theſe Acts of Worſhip might ſeem to be of a Carnal and Groſs Nature; and though there be places enough, in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſpeak forth God to be a Spiritual and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Being; to be Holy and Good; yet from theſe parts of his Service, look'd upon in themſelves alone, Men could not learn ſo much.</p>

                  <p>I deny, not <hi>Theophilus,</hi> what you ſay; but then you muſt Remember the whole that was ſaid; <hi>viz.</hi> That only ſuch Laws are enjoyn'd, which have an intrinſick Goodneſs in them; or elſe are for Ends abſolutely Good; and ſuch as are diſcernable by every one.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we are initiated into the Church of Chriſt, becoming Members to him our Head; and have the guilt of Sin waſh'd away; <hi>Baptiſm being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the Remiſſion of Sins; Acts</hi> 2.38. And we are alſo thereby made <hi>partakers of the benefits of Chriſts Death,</hi> into which we are Baptized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.6. In which Rite, our Lawgiver (as in every thing he exceeded what was done before,) hath amplified his Seal, by making it applicable to both Sexes, when in Circumciſion it was impreſſed only upon one.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo, the <hi>Eating of Bread and Drinking of Wine,</hi> in the Holy Sacrament, are done in <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Death</hi> and Paſſion of our Lord. And this Remembrance of him is upon the Account that he hath laid down his Life for Mankind, and for ourſelves in that Number. And ſo, as oft as we do this Worthily, and as we ought to do, we are afreſh entituled to that Salvation which by his Death he hath purchaſed for us; and have God the Father Reconciled unto us.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe are excellent Ends; and that to theſe Ends both Baptiſm and the Lords Supper were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, we are expreſsly told in Holy Writ, without any Clouds and Darkneſs; without ſo much as a word that may have a double or doubtful ſignification; that whoever runs may read.</p>
                  <p>Which cannot be ſaid of Sacrifices, and ſome other Significant Rites, among the Jews; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were Types of our Lord (as hath been
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49802:36"/> ſaid,) yet they were not known ſo to be, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the People.</p>
                  <p>And truly, it doth not a little Commend the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, that, in theſe great Acts of our Faith, our Lawgiver is ſo far pleaſed to <hi>condeſcend to our Senſes</hi> as to make the things that may be <hi>Seen and Taſted,</hi> to be the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighers</hi> of ſuch ineſtimable Favours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are indeed things of ordinary uſe: But, in ſo being, they import theſe Divine Priviledges to belong not to the Rich only, and the Great, but to the Meaner Sort alſo. And very rightly ſuted they are to the ends for which they were inſtituted. The Waſhing away of Sins is well ſignified by the Cleanſing of our Bodies with Water; And Chriſts Wounded Body and Spilled Blood are better repreſented by the lowly Elements of Bread broken, and Wine poured out, than by more coſtly and rich Materials they would have been. For we are to Remember him not as in a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and ſplendid, but in an humble and afflicted Condition. Though mean, as a Bit of Bread and Sip of Wine may ſeem; yet very appoſite it is, that our Spiritual Food, by which we are nouriſhed up unto Eternal Life, ſhould be conveighed to us in That which gives Nouriſhment unto, and ſupports our Temporal Life in this World.</p>
                  <p>So that all thoſe Precepts, which, in their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, have an <hi>immediate Relation unto Gods Service,</hi> are ſuch as are <hi>Intrinſically Good;</hi> or elſe ſuch, as may be <hi>ranked with thoſe that</hi> are, for the <hi>admirable Ends</hi> which, <hi>'tis plainly ſhew'd,</hi> they are ordain'd unto.</p>
                  <p>And further yet, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Thoſe Precepts which, <hi>throughout our whole Converſation,</hi> look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, are ſuch as are worthy to be practiſed by <hi>underſtanding Creatures,</hi> towards the moſt <hi>perfect
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49802:37"/> of Beings.</hi> And it would not be juſt to conceive a God in the World, who hath deſerved infinitely well of Man, and not conceive ſuch obedience to be due unto him. Such is the Believing and Truſting in him; the ſubmitting our Wills unto his; and the Doing all things to his Glory, and ſuch like. For by theſe He is own'd to be a God of Truth and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; a God of Power and Goodneſs; and to be All in all, the Great and Holy One. And ſurely Thoſe Laws cannot but be in themſelves truly Good, which ſo faſhion the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men, that they appoſitely ſhall <hi>anſwer</hi> to <hi>thoſe perfections</hi> which are in God; and thereby (as far as Man's Nature is capable,) become partakers of them.</p>
                  <p>And how genuine a pleaſure is it for a Soul thus <hi>to believe</hi> in Him, who cannot be Deceived himſelf, and who will not Deceive us! Who hath Revealed Truths which have been hid from Ages: Truths, that include the greateſt Wonder and alſo the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Love! And were it not a Command that ſo we ſhould do, what would we be more Solicitous for, or what more ſeek after, than the Priviledge of <hi>Repoſing Truſt</hi> in one who never faileth thoſe, that with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian confidence rely upon him? When we are, as of ourſelves unable to ſee thoſe things which ſhall be for our good; and very forward to look to thoſe things that will be for our hurt, it ſure is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Command that requires <hi>our Wills</hi> to be Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unto <hi>His,</hi> whoſe perfection it is to will only thoſe things which are beſt. And ſince the deſigns of Men ſo often create them trouble; and nothing, that here they enjoy, can give them true ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what can be a more <hi>noble End</hi> to all the Actions of Men, than that which is the End, the Almighty propoſeth unto himſelf; and which gives him Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal delight in the obtaining it, <hi>viz. His Glory?</hi> If, as all our powers and faculties proceed from him, we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49802:37"/> ſhall, in all things, improve them unto him, there will be no cauſe for us to complain, that they are loſt to Ourſelves, by being found in Him. But we ſhall be filled with that Glory, which we do ſo Adminiſter unto.</p>
                  <p>And, leſt the Goodneſs, which theſe Laws have in them, ſhould be injured by an undue Practice, they are to be <hi>obey'd in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and no otherwiſe. Gods Glory is to be our continual Aim, but we muſt not go about <hi>to promote it by a Lye,</hi> or, any thing that is Evil. The <hi>keeping of our Souls is to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God;</hi> but it muſt be in <hi>Well-doing.</hi> And the like is there for all others Laws; which both ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and eſtabliſheth, their Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Neither are thoſe Laws, which <hi>more nearly reſpect Men</hi> of a different Make from the other; we, by theſe, are enjoyn'd the Exerciſe of Righteouſneſs, Mercy, and Kindneſs. And what would a Man wiſh ſhould by others be Practiſed to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and <hi>his Friend dear as himſelf,</hi> ſooner than theſe? Theſe do not, from any thing we poſſeſs, wring out the Tears of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans and Widow. <hi>No Stone is there to cry out of the Wall, nor Beam to anſwer it out of the Timber.</hi> We by <hi>them</hi> are taught to rejoyce at the Welfare of others, as if it were the Fruit of our Prayers: To eſteem the Bleſſings, which we ourſelves do enjoy, to be the greater, becauſe thereby we are enabled to do the more good. By <hi>them</hi> alſo a <hi>True Reliſh</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in our Meats and Drinks; and they are made to <hi>hold out Health</hi> and <hi>Long Life</hi> unto us, by freeing us from thoſe Surfeits and Exceſſes, which would turn the moſt pleaſant and wholſom things nto Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and Poiſon. In a Word, theſe Laws (how many, or of what ſort ſoever they be,) are ſuch as <hi>perfect our Natures,</hi> and <hi>capacitate us for a better World when this is done:</hi> For, a Man, without the Practice of theſe, would be altogether as far from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49802:38"/> reaching to the Glory of a Saint, as a Beaſt is from being improved into the Excellencies of a Man. And <hi>(Theophilus,) thay</hi> (which is not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,) have nothing of <hi>dark Ceremony annexed,</hi> to <hi>be obſerved with the ſame Care as we do the ſubſtance of the Duties themſelves.</hi> Wherefore, upon theſe accounts alſo, we have very great Inducements to Love the Divine Laws.</p>

                  <p>I can eaſily grant, that, from the Intrinſick Goodneſs of theſe Laws, there is a very ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to Love them; But is it, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> ſo great an one, that theſe Laws which have an Intrinſick Goodneſs <hi>ſhould Alone be enjoyn'd?</hi> I therefore ask this, becauſe, I remember, you ſaid, that the <hi>ſitting ſome inferiour Laws to the Temper of the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did the better fit that People for the obſervance of thoſe Laws which were in their own Nature Moral.</hi>
                  </p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a very great Inducement to our Love, that <hi>thoſe Laws alone</hi> ſhould be enjoyned, which have an Intrinſick Goodneſs in them. For now, as our whole Duty is <hi>reaſonable,</hi> ſo we have it in a <hi>little room;</hi> and may the better underſtand, and do it; which would not ſo well be done, by reaſon of the vaſt Number of Laws, if all People, whereſoever ſcatter'd, ſhould have had ſome ſuted to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which are ſo Various.</p>
                  <p>The giving of the Chriſtian Laws, and of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick, was very different. Thoſe by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were only, or chiefly, to the Jews. God having then <hi>his Tabernacle in Salem, and his dwelling place in Sion;</hi> and among <hi>Them alone,</hi> of <hi>all the Inhabitants of the Earth, He choſe to place his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, over and above, as he was their God, ſo (as was before ſaid,) at the giving of theſe Laws, he was their <hi>Temporal Prince.</hi> And therefore the Nation being <hi>one People,</hi> he might the better ſute ſome Laws to their Temper. Which in much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wiſdom he did;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49802:38"/> in the Judicial Law apparently; and not leſs in the Ceremonial; making That which did ſo much Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie the future Kingdom of the Meſſias, to hit alſo the Conſtitution of their Climate; which enclined them much to a Variety of Rites, and a Ceremonious way of Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Yet not ſo did God ſute his Laws to their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as, in every thing, to Cloſe with them. But, he, in a manner, did cultivate that People; keeping them in Action by the Number and Diverſity of Laws; and bringing them under, as it were, by Curbs and Bridles; whereas, otherwiſe, they would have been extravagant, and, more than they were (though that enough;) a Stiff-necked People. Thus were the Laws in many things ſuted to their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, not to <hi>Sooth</hi> but <hi>Govern</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But now, the Chriſtian Laws are given, not to one Nation alone, but to the whole World; <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Greek or Jew, Barbarian, or Scythian, Bond or Free.</hi> And therefore, it cannot be expected, that Laws ſhould be fitted to every Nation and Climate, <hi>any otherwiſe,</hi> than as they are <hi>very agreeable to the Nature and Souls of Men,</hi> who are willing rightly to diſcern things, and to act accordingly. And what multiplicity of Ceremonies and outward Reſtraints in <hi>Judea</hi> did, more Rational Conſiderations and Spiritual Motives are now, in the wide World, to effect.</p>
                  <p>But yet <hi>thoſe Laws,</hi> which may be agreeable to the <hi>different Climates</hi> where Chriſtians Live, and which may promote the better obſervation of thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Precepts of our Lawgiver, are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Yea, God, ſince he hath ceas'd to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a Theocracy on Earth, hath left a Power in the Hand of <hi>his Church</hi> for the conſtituting ſuch Rites and Ceremonies as ſhall fulfill the Apoſtle's Rule, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi> And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49802:39"/> ſince our Affections are apt to languiſh, where our ſenſes are no way exerciſed, it will be but requiſite for her to exert that Power and Prudence, which God hath endowed her with, in appointing ſuch outward Geſtures, and other ſeemly Uſages, as may meetly eſtabliſh a Decency in our Worſhip, and be inſtrumental to the raiſing of our Hearts Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And, I may ſay, God hath allowed this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church, as <hi>ſomthing Correſpondent</hi> to his <hi>own Power in the Jewiſh State,</hi> of <hi>appointing Religious Rites</hi> for the <hi>better carrying on</hi> of his <hi>more Sacred Service.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, for Civil Magiſtrates, he hath veſted them alſo with a Power of making Laws; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of uſing or refuſing the Judicial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any part of it, ſo far forth as it ſhall be more or leſs uſeful to the Weal Publick, and the ſecuring thoſe Duties both to God and Men, which the Sacred Precepts do Command. Which Laws of Princes, their reſpective Subjects are, by the Divine Law, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Conſcionably to obey.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe, whether Eccleſiaſtical, or Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, may be <hi>varied</hi> according as the <hi>Climate</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> do vary. And thereby the number of Sacred Laws is the leſs, and their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance the more facile and certain; and the <hi>Honour alſo</hi> of <hi>Governours</hi> is the firmlier eſtabliſhed, in their being made ſo Inſtrumental for the Good of Society, wherever they bear rule.</p>

                  <p>You'l pardon me, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> that, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing ſomtimes, I delay your progreſs: Though, truly I have little reaſon to repent of my Fault, ſince, in the things I doubt of, you ſet me on better ground, than, for ought I know, I am, in many things, which I ſeem to be more ſure of. The Divine Laws may well claim our Love, not only in that they are all truely Good, and very ſutable to Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49802:39"/> but alſo in that they, having none other of a Lower rank mixed with them, are the more ſurely and eaſily known; and do likewiſe afford ſo good a Scope for Governours to <hi>Signalize their Prudence</hi> in conſtituting ſuch Laws, which, not unagreeable to the Law of God, ſhall be moſt agreeable to the Temper of thoſe who are under them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>As they do allow the <hi>exerciſe of Prudence to Governours,</hi> ſo do they alſo to <hi>private Men,</hi> in Ten Thouſand actions of their Lives, which are not commanded nor forbidden by the Law of God; That, following their own Inclinations, and doing as ſhall ſeem to them beſt, they may have the greater content and ſatisfaction therefrom.</p>
                  <p>This, in <hi>our private actions,</hi> is that Liberty which by our Lawgiver is indulged us; and is uſually term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> As our Actions have relation to the <hi>publick,</hi> and are Subject to the Laws of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, it is <hi>Chriſtian Liberty to have a power of obeying thoſe Superiours in what they Command,</hi> (how various ſoever their Commands are,) whether in a different, or in the ſame Nation; ſo far forth as they ſhall not be <hi>contrary to the Divine Laws.</hi> And this may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtian Liberty in oppoſition to the Moſaick ſtraitneſs; which required the Jews, and all who ſhould be Proſelyted unto them, to practiſe thoſe Laws, whether Ritual or Civil, and none other to the omiſſion of thoſe.</p>
                  <p>And though ſome of thoſe were not to be exerciſed out of the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> where their Temple ſtood; and ſo, were forborn of old by the Jews in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and, at this day, are not obſerved by them in their diſperſions up and down the World; yet it was, and is, eſteemed their Calamity, thus to be hindred by diſtance of place from the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>And one thing more there is, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> (which I take to be of no mean Concern,) That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49802:40"/> Laws, though they be all ſutable to our Natures, as we are Men, yet are ſuch alſo, as, in our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will <hi>much comply with our particular Way and Temper.</hi> If we are of diſpoſition inclining to Sadneſs and Melancholy, they will allow us to be moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the Duties of Mortification; of Fearing God; of Sorrowing for Sin; of Renouncing the World and the Vanities thereof. If we are of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per more Lively and Cheerful; the more Cheerful Duties, of Rejoycing in Gods Mercies, of Praiſing him in his Works, of doing him Service in publick Juſtice, and other Virtues Inſtrumental to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Society, will be permitted unto us. And our Lawgiver (ſo Gracious is he,) will accept us, in either of theſe ways; and account his other Laws not to be diſobeyed, though they be not ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn out into Practice.</p>
                  <p>Whence, the Chriſtian Laws, although in the Body of them they have none, that are made for the particular Tempers of Nations, as the Jewiſh Law had for theirs, do yet, in all theſe ways, allow a Compliance with Temper and Conſtitutions; and may well be very much Loved upon this account; but cannot, in any Reaſon, be found fault with, as if they did not allow any ſuch thing.</p>

                  <p>I thank you for what you have ſaid; as being inſtructed well, and not a little cheer'd from your diſcourſe: But will ſay no more; becauſe I long for the Third thing which renders the Chriſtian Law Worthy to be Loved;</p>
                  <p>Viz. <hi>That thoſe Moral Laws which were given to the Jews, are by our Lawgiver more Fully and Clearly given.</hi>

                  <p>Since you are ſo deſirous of it, I will not keep you in Suſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>As deliver'd by Chriſt, their Scope and Intent is more plainly diſcern'd. He hath vindicated them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49802:40"/> from the ill Interpretation of the Phariſees; and hath placed their Dignity and Excellence, not in the Outward Obſervance alone, which the Jews did chiefly aim at, but in the Heart eſpecially, without which External Performances are little worth. And therefore, in the beginning of his Sermon upon the Mount, He endeavours rightly to inſtruct the Heart and Soul, by acquainting thoſe who are his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, That <hi>They are bleſſed</hi> who are <hi>poor in Spirit;</hi> who <hi>are meek;</hi> who <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> who <hi>are pure in Heart, &amp;c.</hi> Which Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions denote, that the Mind ſhould be rightly fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and that They, who give up their Names unto him, muſt have their Souls brought into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and adorned.</p>
                  <p>He tells them, that <hi>They are the Salt of the Earth,</hi> and will be good for nothing unleſs they endeavour to ſeaſon others by their exemplary Converſation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.13. <hi>They are the Light of the World,</hi> and ſo <hi>they muſt ſhine before others, that their good Works may be ſeen, and God glorified.</hi> V. 16. He extends the Commandment of <hi>doing no Murther,</hi> even to the <hi>not being angry with another without a cauſe.</hi> V. 22. The Precept of <hi>not committing Adultery,</hi> he makes reach even to the forbidding of <hi>Luſtful Looks and Deſires.</hi> V. 28. He forbids <hi>all Divorces, unleſs in the caſe of Fornication.</hi> V. 32. He reſtored <hi>Marriage</hi> to its Primitive Perfection by <hi>prohibiting Polygamy, Matth.</hi> 19.5. <hi>They Two ſhall be one Fleſh,</hi> Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, <hi>They Two,</hi> as excluſive of more; which we learn from V. 9. of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife except it be for Fornication, and ſhall marry another, committeth Adultery.</hi> For, how weak would it have been to pronounce it A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery for a Man to marry after a Divorce, if the adding one Wife to another before a Divorce ſhould be no Adultery? And if it ſhall be ſaid, that our
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49802:41"/> Lord orders it as a puniſhment to him, who puts away his Wife, not to marry another; but permits thoſe to marry more than one, who put away none; it may be replyed, That ſurely the Puniſhment might little be feared, becauſe it might be ſo eaſily avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For who need care, whether he married or not, after the putting away a Wife, if he might marry as many as he would before? And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that He, who is the Wiſdom of God, ſhould ground any Law upon ſo ſandy a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He diſallows <hi>of Swearing,</hi> how true ſoever, in ordinary Converſation, Verſ. 34. He prohibits all <hi>Revenge,</hi> in that we are not to reſiſt an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſo, as to pay an Injury for an Injury, V. 39. He commands <hi>Love</hi> to be ſhewed <hi>even</hi> to <hi>Enemies, Bleſſings to be given to thoſe that curſe us,</hi> V. 44. And truly this Command, and the foregoing one, may ſeem to be added by our Saviour as not having the Law of Nature for its Foundation, according to which the Decalogue was framed; but being built upon that Love which our Saviour afterwards did ſhew, when he died for his Enemies. For the Law of Nature may ſeem to allow of this, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t no cui quis noceat, niſi laceſſitus injuriâ,</hi> Cic. But, when injured, he may requite it. <hi>When we do Alms,</hi> we muſt not have reſpect unto our own Glory, but only to the Glory of God, and the Good of the Miſerable. Chap. 6. V. 1. <hi>When we Pray and Faſt,</hi> both muſt be done with a devout ſecreſie, that God in both may be chiefly looked unto, and the Eye of Men not cared for. V. 16. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, while on Earth, to have our Hearts in Heaven; <hi>To lay up Treaſures</hi> there, by laying them out here, in Charitable and Virtuous Deeds. V. 19. We are forbid to <hi>be anxiouſly concern'd</hi> for any things of this World, though never ſo neceſſary; but are, with a devout ſubmiſſion, to depend upon
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49802:41"/> God, and <hi>to lay all our cares</hi> upon him. V. 25. We are commanded <hi>not to judge others,</hi> nor to be Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious towards them; but are to think no evil of them; to put the beſt Interpretation upon their Actions, and to look with a <hi>ſtrict Eye</hi> upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only. Chap. 7.1, 2. Yea, in all our behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards others, to obſerve that excellent Rule of <hi>doing to Them whatſoever we would that They ſhould do unto us.</hi> What Precepts can there be more full and clear than theſe are? Can the Decalogue be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter interpreted than by them? Is there not in them a more perfect and ſpiritual Senſe, than can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcern'd in the Old Law? If, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy Law is pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it;</hi> what Heights of Love muſt the purity of theſe Laws raiſe up in us? More largely, and clearer by far, are our Duties towards God, and our Neighbours, here delivered; far more Reaſon then have we to love them.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the <hi>Laws</hi> which immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect <hi>a mans ſelf,</hi> we ſhall find, that they are much more fully given unto us, than under the Old Law they were.</p>
                  <p>It hath been obſerv'd by ſome, that in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, ſtrictly conſider'd there <hi>are no Precepts to be found that immediately reſpect a Mans ſelf.</hi> And it may ſeem to be ſo far true, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are hardly any there, but what are included in, and deducible from thoſe, that <hi>primarily look another way.</hi> And therefore, if we will rightly conſider things, the Laws that reſpect ourſelves are <hi>more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the New Teſtament;</hi> at leaſt, are there more directly and openly enjoyn'd; Such are the Precepts, <hi>If our Right Hand offend us, to cut it off; If our Right Eye, to pluck it out.</hi> Such alſo are other Precepts tending towards Mortification; The preſerving not only our Bodies free from Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49802:42"/> but the keeping them under, that we may be pure and clean, both in Body and Soul. The bearing of Afflictions and Injuries with a patient and quiet Spirit, and others not unlike unto theſe.</p>
                  <p>Whoever ſhall look into the Laws given us as we are Chriſtians, muſt needs confeſs, whether they reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God, our Neighbour, or ourſelves, that they are, at leaſt, much more fully and clearly given than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were: If yet <hi>ſome</hi> of the greateſt purity and Excellence be <hi>not added;</hi> and ſo we have a great Enducement, on this Conſideration alſo, to Love them.</p>

                  <p>By this their Clearneſs, Fulneſs, and Perfection, they are fitted for the greateſt extenſion of our Faculties, and the moſt Heroick Endeavours both of our Souls and Bodies. Yea, could we riſe to the higheſt pitch of Virtue that Mortality is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, we ſhould find room in them, for even yet Nobler Attainments; and thoſe, ſuch as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our ſtill preſſing forwards, till the laſt Moment of our Lives.

                  <p>I know there are ſome, who, in good earneſt, dare thus urge againſt the Laws of our Lord; but they are Men of corrupt minds; and by their ill Lives are ſway'd to talk after this manner; leſt they ſhould appear to have Opinions any whit better than their Practice. A ſhame it is, that any in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common-wealth, where Chriſtianity affords ſo many outward benefits to them, ſhould, without ſevere puniſhment, be permitted to ſpeak againſt the Laws of Chriſt. But when ſuch a <hi>vile Liberty</hi> is ſo much <hi>uſurped,</hi> it will be but meet, with Truth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend theſe Laws.

                  <p>There is indeed a very great Room for Reaſon in our Holy Religion; which claims admittance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hearts of Men, by Arguments as great and ſtrong, as any conſidering Man would deſire: There being no rational grounds to think, that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and Apoſtles did publiſh Falſhoods in their Writings; but the greateſt reaſon for our belief, that what they have Written is True and Divine.</p>
                  <p>But then, when by Reaſon we have admitted of the Truth and Divinity of the Scriptures, we are not to imagin, that we can comprehend every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing therein contain'd, with the ſame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by which we conceive the Truth of the Scriptures in general.

                  <p>Yea, yet further; Every, even the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Myſtery there, gives us ſo much the uſe of our Reaſon and Underſtanding, as to think that it is but <hi>Reaſonable,</hi> the <hi>Chief</hi> of the Ways and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods

                  <p>I would not compare theſe great Myſteries with ſmall things: But yet to theſe Men I may ſay, that every thing in Nature which they look upon, and know that it is if I ſhould ask them how it comes to be ſo, they mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, as I ſaid before; Although the Things we are to believe are high, (who can throughly know them?) yet the Law that bids us believe is Clear and Intelligible: And it may very well deſerve our Love, becauſe there are none of theſe Myſteries, which we are to believe, but what our Wellfare and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are Founded in; and what are inſtrumental to the Birth and Exerciſe of thoſe excellent Virtues, which the other Laws of our Lord do enjoyn: Yea, ſo far as they are Revealed unto us, they are to be Reſted in, not Pryed into.

                  <p>THE Severities of the Chriſtian Laws are not unreaſonable; neither do they reduce us to ſuch ſtraights, as cannot be gone through without a great deal of uneaſineſs, if at all. The Deſign of our Lord is not to beat down our Natural Inclinations and Appetites, but to rectifie them. Our Diſpoſitions, if well managed, not averſe from a right Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Laws of Chriſt do not daſh the pleaſure of Converſation, by threatning idle Words with the Day of Judgment. The Loving of Enemies, while they perſiſt to be injurious, is in itſelf not unmeet, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equitable, in caſe the Hiſtory of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption be true. Faſting and Abſtinence not unreaſonable; nor the parting with Eſtates and Lives for the aſſerting of the Goſpel. From the Laws of Chriſt we have a fair way for the Pardon of all Sins. What the Law of Faith require of us. How much it is different from the Old Law. What the Law of Repentance is. Too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny make Faith and Repentance to ſtand in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49802:45"/> oppoſition to the other Laws of our Lord. How the Laws being done away, which was Engraven on Stones, is to be underſtood. Repentance for Sin, cannot without the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Abſurdity be wreſted to the further and more ſafe committing of Sin. The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Thief on the Croſs, and of the Labourers in the Vineyard at the Eleventh Hour, conſider'd. None of the Divine Laws unſuitable to one another. Theſe Laws of themſelves are grievous unto none. As they have relation only to Civil Society, and the welfare of Men in this World, they do far ſurpaſs thoſe of the moſt noted Lawgivers, They by no means do favour the Opinion, that Right of Poſſeſſion is Founded in Grace. And that it is Lawful to reſiſt Sovereign Princes in the Maintenance of True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They make the Man truly beautiful within.</p>

                  <p>Truly, I think, this is the whole, they can object; and with how little Reaſon they do it, I ſhall, I truſt, ſufficiently ſhew.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, <hi>viz. That the Laws of Chriſt beat down thoſe Inclinations and Appetites which are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to us,</hi> (which Objection may ſeem to have ſome kind of ſhare in all the other,) we ſay,</p>
                  <p>That Inclinations and Appetites may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either as belonging to Nature in a pure and perfect State, or, as it is corrupted and depraved; (for deeply corrupted our Nature is, and was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo to be by the Heathen wiſe Men, though they were ignorant of the cauſe why it was ſo) Now the Laws of Chriſt do not oppoſe Mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49802:47"/> and Appetites, conſidering Nature in its perfect State; but do then only correct and curb them, when, by reaſon of the Corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are crooked and irregular, and lanch out into Vicious Exceſſes.</p>
                  <p>In a word, The Deſign of our Lord, in his Laws, is, to reduce us, as much as poſſible, to our Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Perfection: Not, in a Stoical manner, to beat down our Appetites, out to rectifie them, that they may be truly commendable in themſelves, and may convince us of the Equity of the Commands of Chriſt, by giving an Eternal Pleaſure and Satisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. For <hi>if any Man do his Will,</hi> he ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find, that <hi>his Commands are not grievous,</hi> but that <hi>all his Ways are Pleaſantneſs, and all his Paths are Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it ſhall be urged, That our Natures are here incapable of ſuch a Perfection as is talk'd of, and therefore that the Laws which enjoyn it are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; we may reply,</p>
                  <p>That our Natures, as now they are, are capable of far greater Perfection and Regularity, than theſe, who thus plead, are willing to admit of. And we may ſay, that even now there are Inclinations of two ſorts; Thoſe that ariſe from Nature, and Thoſe that we ourſelves do, in a great meaſure, make. Nature requires but what is enough; but ill Deſires, heightned by ill Cuſtoms, require for Luxury and Exceſs. Now, Temperance amidſt our Earthly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; Contentation in the State which God hath placed us in; A Readineſs to part with ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our Abundance, for the good of thoſe that need; A Charity in interpreting their Actions well; And a neglecting of Vain-glory, and ſuch like things as theſe, are not ſuch impoſſible things to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; Nay, the contrary ſhall perhaps bring more Difficulties and Pains, than the Obſervance of theſe Laws ſhall.</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49802:47"/>
                  <p>For we muſt not forget, that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is no leſs Natural unto us than any Inclinations or Appetites we have; yea, it may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claim the Precedence of them. They being, in a great meaſure, common unto <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> and <hi>Beaſts;</hi> but This the Peculiar of <hi>Men</hi> only. And what is the uſe of this thing call'd <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is ſo Natural unto us, but this, <hi>viz.</hi> To regulate our Appetites and Inclinations when they grow exorbitant, and to give us the great Satisfaction of having acted like Men?</p>
                  <p>So that, in an impartial Conſideration of things, it will be found to be more agreeable to Nature to repreſs our ſenſitive Appetites and Inclinations by Reaſon, than to give them their ſwinge without Reaſon: The Rational part in Man being far the more Noble.</p>
                  <p>Now, Reaſon cannot but approve of, and cloſe with, theſe Excellent and Refined Laws of our Lord. Nay, our Inclinations themſelves, would we but ſeriouſly ſet ourſelves to the bringing them into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, might, in ſome time, be duly brought into it.</p>
                  <p>And, truly, it hath been very well obſerved of the Conſtitutions of particular Perſons, (and we therein may give Praiſe to him that made us,) that as every Temperament doth, ſome way or other, evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe the Man, ſo his being thus diſpoſed ſets him at the greater diſtance from another Evil. As the being prone to Fearfulneſs removes him far from the oppoſite Evil of Preſumptuouſneſs. Nay, he is hereby rendred ſomthing inclined to that Good, which lies next to his Diſpoſition; the All-wiſe God ſo ordering it, that defects are not wholly deſtitute of ſomthing at Hand to make them up. Thus, the being Cholerick enclines the Man to Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs, Melancholy bends him towards Devotion. The being Phlegmatick borders him upon Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49802:48"/> A Proneneſs to Anger prompts him to Activeneſs. So that if we ourſelves will but be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and reſolute in bringing the ill inclinations of our Nature, or of our particular Conſtitutions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Order, according to the Laws of our Lord, we ſhall find it a work not ſo intolerably hard, as ſome would make it, and would have others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be.</p>
                  <p>And as thus our Diſpoſitions, if well managed, are not averſe from a right Improvement; ſo our Affections and Deſires, if they be but removed from an Object leſs good to one that is more Excellent, (and this may oftentimes eaſily be done,) they may retain the ſame earneſtneſs, and find more rational Gratifications: Yea, ſomtimes the Work is leſs; and it is only the bringing the Affection ſomthing lower, or raiſing it a little higher, and the Object need not be changed.</p>
                  <p>We ſee, how much Uſe and Exerciſe will prevail upon Men's Bodies, to make them Supple and Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant unto thoſe Motions, which Nature, of itſelf, is unacquainted with; and ſhall the Soul of Man not be able to correct Natural, but Corrupt Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Let us take but as much pains with our Souls, as ſome have done with their Bodies, and I doubt not, but (through Gods Grace,) we ſhall make them as pliable to the Motions of Goodneſs and Virtue, as ſome Men's Joynts and Limbs are to thoſe Motions which at the firſt they were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt unto.</p>
                  <p>It was, as I Remember, in the Objection you brought, That <hi>Theſe Laws are unreaſonable to us as we are Men;</hi> whereas, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> as we are Men, they, in a peculiar manner, are fitted <hi>for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and <hi>for no Beings beſide.</hi> Thoſe that are Brutal, by their being deſtitute of underſtanding, are below them: And thoſe that are Heavenly (<hi>viz.</hi> Bleſſed Angels
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49802:48"/> and Saints) ſeem to be above them; whoſe Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, wholly bent to the love of Holineſs, can never be guilty of exceſs. Their Pleaſures admit of no Temperance nor Reſtrictions; but the more high, and exerted they be, the more refined and excellent they are. But we are of a middle Nature, between the Brutal and the Heavenly; and partake ſomthing of both. Our Pleaſures are dangerous; our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are very apt to be exceſſive; and we have Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to moderate and repreſs them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are carefully to do it, that from ſuch Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Reſtraints we may be Virtuous, and have praiſe both with God and Men.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, a curbing of the Appetites of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even theſe Men themſelves, however they object it againſt the Laws of Chriſt, will, upon more conſiderate thoughts, like well of and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</p>
                  <p>They cannot but approve of the Fidelity of thoſe to each other, whom the Marriage-Bond hath uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and they would deteſt a Spurious Iſſue to be brought forth by thoſe whom they have by Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock encloſed to themſelves alone: But this could not be, but by ſome reſtraint put upon thoſe Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites which are Natural.</p>
                  <p>And ſhall they be willing to admit of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints for the good of the Community, and for their own ſatisfaction alſo; and ſhall they find fault with them in Religion?</p>
                  <p>And if the Holy Laws of Chriſt ſhall not only make us fit to live among Men, by putting a Bridle on thoſe Inclinations, as to the outward Act; but ſhall alſo render us well-pleaſing in the ſight of God, by keeping up Chaſtity in the Heart, and a Cleanneſs in the Soul; ſhall any be ſo devoid of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to urge this as an Argument againſt the Laws of Chriſt, and not rather be willing to eſteem it the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49802:49"/> Honour of theſe Laws, and the great Credit of thoſe who give Obedience to them?</p>
                  <p>This they may be ſure of, that the prohibiting ſome Inclinations, even as to their moſt inward Motions, however it may ſeem ſevere, is yet in reality the facilitating of our Obedience, as to the whole of it. For, how eaſie is it for him to abſtain from Adultery, who dares not luſt? The Laws would have been difficult indeed, if they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the Effects, and, at the ſame time, allow'd the Appetites.</p>
                  <p>Yea, I might yet further ſay, That there is in our Nature a Principle of Modeſty and Shamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which doth as much reſiſt unclean and carnal Actings, as our Inclinations may ſeem to promote them. And he who keeps under his Appetite, doth not offer ſo great a Violence to his Nature, as he doth, who, by giving the Reins to his ſenſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, brings Shame and a Bluſh.</p>
                  <p>Diſgrace before Men ſits more uneaſie upon the libidinous Actor, than the reſtraining of his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite would have done. This later would have been but his private pain (if his pain,) for a time; the other laſts the longer for being publick, and ſtrikes a greater torment into him by being ſo.</p>
                  <p>Yea, though the unclean Perſon ſhould eſcape Cognizance of Men, yet his own Thoughts would upbraid him, as having acted <hi>poorly,</hi> and <hi>below the Excellence of a Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> been as earneſt and long upon this Subject, as if theſe Men had been preſent with us; and I wiſh they had been ſo, if what we have ſaid might have had any good effect upon them. I am ſure, could we regulate their Wills, it would be no difficult thing to convince their Underſtandings, That the Laws of our Lord are, in reſpect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclinations and Appetites, very reaſonable, yea, truly excellent.</p>

                  <p>Well it would be, that, if theſe Men will not, by a right managing of their Appetites, be Virtuous, they were of that Rank of Creatures, which, by an uncontroul'd yielding to their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, are not Vicious.</p>

                  <p>But let us proceed to another unreaſonable thing, which they object againſt the Chriſtian Laws: <hi>viz. That they daſh the pleaſure of Converſation, by threatning every Word that is impertinent, or awry, with the dreadful day of Judgment, Matt</hi> 12.36. which, inſtead of <hi>Cheerfulneſs in a Mans ſelf, and Courteſie to his Friends,</hi> may <hi>in Him excite an Anxious Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> and towards <hi>Them a ſilent or Moroſe deportment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> a very great miſtake concerning idle Words, to think, that an innocent Cheerfulneſs, and a kind and Courteous Converſe, is ſtruck at by our Lord. No, were there nothing elſe, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample might teach us to interpret him otherwiſe. He came not, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, in a rough and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere manner, <hi>But Eating and Drinking, i. e.</hi> in an Amicable, Friendly, and Sociable way; Having the <hi>Law of kindneſs in his Mouth;</hi> and obliging Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by his Verbal Expreſſions, as well as doing them good by his outward Actions.</p>
                  <p>There are two Interpretations of our Lawgivers Speech concerning idle Words. One is, That, by them, all ſuch Words are meant, as are Un-profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both to thoſe that ſpeak them, and thoſe whom they are ſpoken unto.</p>
                  <p>The other Interpretation is this, That all Evil, Falſe, and reviling Words, are primarily meant. The occaſion of our Lords ſpeaking them, being from the Phariſees, ſaying, <hi>That he caſt out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils.</hi> Hereupon we are told, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Idle Word</hi> is ſomtimes read <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Evil Word.</hi> And though the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſhould be the truer Reading, yet ſtill it would
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49802:50"/> be but little different; for <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſignifies <hi>Vain;</hi> and <hi>Vain</hi> is, in Scripture-meaning, the ſame with <hi>Falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> take whether of theſe Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you will; I cannot ſee how the pleaſure of Converſation will thereby be beaten down. He would deſerve to be excluded from all Friendly Society, who ſhould cenſure innocent Freedom, and cheerful Talk, in the number of idle Words. If in the midſt of worldly cares and trouble, they refreſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the Speakers and Hearers, how can they be ſaid to be uſeleſs to both? Nay, if they Adminiſter to the Vertues of Courteouſneſs and Affability, of Kindneſs and Friendſhip, the account of them, at the laſt day, we may hope, will be joyful; And ſo, the Anxious Fearfulneſs, and the Silent or Moroſe Deportment (which was talk'd of,) may be laid aſide.</p>
                  <p>It is very fit, that the <hi>Beſt Member,</hi> which a Man hath, ſhould be under a Law; and I readily yield, that by Idle Words, the <hi>Filthineſs,</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Jeſtings that are not convenient;</hi> and likewiſe, all Malicious and Perverſe Speaking, are utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. But by the Prohibition of theſe, and by the Tongues being brought under a Law, Converſation is very much promoted; which, were there no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over the Mouth, would be ſhrewdly Wounded, if not quite overthrown. An Ingenious Perſon would chooſe the greateſt Solitude rather than Company, ſhould he there find Tongues let looſe to Idle Impertinencies; or imploy'd in nothing but Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenities, or Scurrilous and Unſavory Reflections.</p>
                  <p>Neither will Converſation be leſſen'd, or rendred leſs pleaſing, by the intermixtion of matters that are more Serious and Profitable: And theſe are reckoned, by the moſt ingenious of all the Poets, the beſt Enjoyments of Society. <hi>Sermo oritur non de villis, domibuſque alienis; Nec bene necne Lepos Saltet.</hi> We
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49802:50"/> talk not, ſaith he, of other Folks buſineſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; nor yet enquire, whether ſuch an one Danceth well or no; <hi>Sed quod magis ad nos pertinet, &amp; neſcire malum eſt, agitamus;</hi> but, what more concerns us, and which it would ill become us to be ignorant of, That is our Diſcourſe. As whether Riches or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue make Men Happy: Whether Honeſty or Profit ſhould be the ground of Friendſhip: What is the Nature of Goodneſs; and wherein it is, that the chief Good conſiſteth, Chriſtianity well allows of ſuch Diſcourſe, and affords a large Field for it. And ſurely, the Heavens or the Earth, the effects of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence at large, or thoſe things that more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately relate to our own or Neighbours advantage, may ſeem little obliged to us, if they cannot engage us from idle or disingenuous Speeches.</p>
                  <p>Some, <hi>(Theophilus,)</hi> for the avoiding of Idle Words have addicted themſelves, in all Companies, to the talk of Religion; and ſomtimes (not to the pleaſure of all,) have been forward to declare their own particular Evidences, and the ſecret Favours of God to their Souls: Thinking it, poſſibly, no more than their duty ſo to do. But, ſurely, the former is not neceſſary: <hi>Let your Speech be ſeaſoned with Salt,</hi> implies, (as one well Comments it,) that as our Meat ſhould have a Reliſh from Salt, ſo our Speech ſhould have the Savour of Religion. But that it ſhould be wholly of Religion, is not any more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than that our Meat ſhould be wholly Salt. And for the later, I may ſay, That Spiritual Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and the Secret Favours which God may have vouch-ſafed to us, ſhould have a kind of Modeſty attending them, which ſhould forbid the ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Auditors and Spectators. He, that ſaid <hi>Cerne, Dionyſia, faſtum depoſui,</hi> See, <hi>Dionyſia,</hi> I have no Pride left, was perchance the more Proud from his Boaſted Humility.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:49802:51"/>
                  <p>Such joyful Sentiments of Gods Mercy and Love ſhould, in ſome reſpect, imitate godly Sorrow and holy Faſting; cauſing the Man <hi>to enter into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, that he may not appear unto Men to rejoyce;</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his Eye alone, who <hi>puts ſuch Gladneſs into the Heart:</hi> Or elſe imparting it to one, or ſome Chriſtian Friends only, where he ſhall not be thought to appear <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſome great one, dearer unto God than other Men.</p>
                  <p>And thus, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> you ſee, what little reaſon there is for the finding fault with our Saviours Laws, as if by forbidding <hi>idle Words,</hi> they overturned all the pleaſure of Society. They rather provide, that Converſation ſhall have the more pleaſure, by all fooliſh, impertinent, deceitful, and opprobrious Talks being diſcarded from it; and by ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and uſeful variety of Diſcourſes being afforded, as ſhall be befitting Men to uſe. In a word, they allow us to be Innocently Chearful, but not Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly Merry; and command our Converſation to be Religious, yet free from Affectedneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion.</p>

Whoever it is, that loves the innocent Enjoyments of Acquaintance and Friends; the kind Expreſſions which they uſe to each other; the grateful Entertainment of profitable and ingenious Diſcourſes, (and who is it, that loves them not?) muſt alſo love the Laws of our Lord, which baniſh all thoſe words that ſhall any way cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or ſower ſo great a Pleaſure. And whoſoever ſhall find fault with theſe Laws, as if they enjoyned a moroſeneſs of Temper, either do not underſtand them, or elſe are for ſuch a licentious and ill-natur'd

                     <hi>The next unreaſonable Thing is the Loving of Enemies, even while they perſiſt to be injurious; which, they ſay, deprives us of that ſenſe of Honour and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which, as we are Men, ſhould belong unto us; and makes way alſo for new and greater Injuries to be done us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that the Loving of Enemies, even when they perſiſt to be injurious, is not ſo unreaſonable a thing, may hence appear; Becauſe ſome of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of Heathens, who had Nature chiefly their Guide, have gone a good ſtep towards it; and do commend the with-holding of Revenge, as very honourable in thoſe that do it, and do urge many good Arguments for it. <hi>Nempe hoc indocti, They are</hi> the ignorant ſort, that would vent their ſpleen upon their Enemies: But <hi>Chryſippus non dicit idem,</hi> Learn'd <hi>Chryſippus</hi> is of another mind, and mild <hi>Thales,</hi> and wiſe <hi>Socrates, Qui partem acceptae ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va inter vincla cieutae, Accuſatori nollet dare:</hi> Who, though, by falſe Accuſations, thrown into Priſon, and condemned to end his Life by drinking Poiſon, would yet, could he have done it, not have given his Accuſer a part with him, <hi>Juv. Sat.</hi> 13. So that if it be Unreaſonable, it is not altogether the fault of Chriſtianity; and they, in ſome meaſure, muſt condemn Thoſe, who have been accounted Wiſe Men in the World, and the great Promoters of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, before they can find fault with the Laws of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed, when the viſible things of the World do all joyn together (as they manifeſtly do,) in a kind of mutual Concord, for the promoting the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Men; (The Sun and Stars not ſhining to themſelves; The Earth not bringing forth Herbs and Fruit upon her own Account; nor the Beaſts
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49802:52"/> and Fowls feeding merely for their own Lives; but all of theſe, either immediately or mediately, for Mans uſe and Service.) And alſo when Men are born into the World more impotent (as truly they are,) than any other Creatures; naked altogether and helpleſs, for a longer time, than what brings many other things to their full Growth and Perfection; and this, that they may owe their being nurs'd up to the Tenderneſs and Care of others, it may ſeem to do more than hint, That, as Friendſhip and Good-will is highly to be maintain'd amongſt us, ſo when, by any Perſons, they are broken, the Breach is not to be continued; but (by friendly yieldings, and the being affected with pity towards the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mens Minds, as we uſually are towards the Diſeaſes of their Bodies,) is preſently to be cloſed up. For ſhall the good of Men, which is ſo carried on by all things elſe, be neglected by ourſelves? Or ſhall the <hi>Paſſion of a Man,</hi> which may quickly wear off, prevail more for our <hi>Diſreſpect,</hi> than the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Human Nature</hi> ſhall for our <hi>kindneſs</hi> to him?</p>
                  <p>But, ſuppoſe that a Retaliation of Injuries be not naturally againſt Juſtice; yet, certainly, theſe Men, who urge the unreaſonableneſs of Loving Enemies, cannot but grant, that, in caſe the Hiſtory of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption be true, it is but juſt and equitable, that our Enemies, while they are Enemies, ſhould be Loved.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>while we were Enemies to Chriſt, he dyed for us;</hi> while we had provoked God to throw his Wrath upon us; a Wrath which would have been greater than we could have born; our Bleſſed Lord, in pity to us, came from Heaven to Save us.</p>
                  <p>And when We, merely by being Loved as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are preſerved from deſtruction, ſhall We think it ſuch an unreaſonable thing to bear a Loving reſpect towards Thoſe who are our Enemies? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49802:52"/> when the greateſt Treſpaſſes which they can commit againſt us, are nothing in Compariſon of thoſe which we have committed againſt God; and which are forgiven us by Him.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, as Chriſt hath born our Image by taking upon him our Nature, ſo there is none of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies but retain in their Nature, as they are Men, the Honour that our Lord hath done us; and, in ſome ſort, do wear his Image. And can we, if we rightly weigh things, ſhew any thing but Love there, where is a Reſemblance of the Son of Man, who hath ſhewed the greateſt Love to us?</p>
                  <p>And though Injuries be done us by Thoſe, who bear the likeneſs of Him that never did wrong to any Man, yet ſo far ſhould thoſe Injuries be from hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of our Love, that they ſhould rather put us in Mind of thoſe great Sins againſt God, which we daily muſt be forgiven: And ſo ſhould quicken us to do that to our Brethren, which God in far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſures, through the Death of Chriſt, doth unto us.</p>
                  <p>Whence, ſuppoſing that there is Truth in Chriſts being our Saviour, the loving of Enemies, even while they perſiſt to be injurious, is not an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but an equitable, thing. And that Chriſts coming into the World to ſave us, is a certain Truth we have the higheſt reaſon to believe.</p>
                  <p>But yet, whereas they further ſay, That the thus loving of Enemies doth take <hi>away that Honour and Courage,</hi> which ſhould belong to us <hi>as Men,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;</p>
                  <p>That it contributes much to our Honour and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: For he that forgives an Injury, is always, in the Act of forgiving, Superiour unto him who is forgiven. And, in not permitting the Miſcarriages of others to diſorder his Paſſions, he doth maintain a Greatneſs of Spirit, which ſome others, who are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49802:53"/> preſently for Revenge and drawing of Swords, are far ſhort of. <hi>Minuti ſemper &amp; infirmi eſt animi, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guique voluptas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltio,</hi> is a true ſaying of the Satyriſt: It is the part of a mean Soul to be looking after Revenge, and taking pleaſure in it.</p>
                  <p>And that Honour which is ſo much talk'd of, and, moſt an end, ſo much ſtood upon, what is it uſually but a Reputation among the vainer, and moſt injudicious ſort of Men? And what pitifully mean Matters ſhall engage ſome in long and coſtly Law-Suits, and others in the venturing their Lives, upon the Account of this empty Reputation and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
                  <p>Let a Man ſhew himſelf to be ſuch, who can va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue an Ingenuous and Chriſtian Carriage towards him; and who can reſent the contrary, but yet will not permit any unworthineſs of others to get the upper-hand of his Reaſon and Charity: Let him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all about him, that he is a Lover of Men; that he deſires their good, much more than he ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs the wrongs they have done him: That he is more inclinable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if they will give him leave,) to ſhew Kindneſs to them, than to act any thing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: That he leaves all Revenge unto God, whom it belongs unto; and yet earneſtly prays, that God will not execute it: Let him do all theſe things, and he will gain more Honour with thoſe that are the moſt underſtanding, ſober and good, (from whom alone Honour deſerves to be termed ſo,) than the Man ever ſhall, who rageth at every petty Injury, and breathes nothing but Threatning and Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and laſtly, inſtead of thoſe new and greater Injuries, which, from ſuch a behaviour towards Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are ſaid to have a fairer way made to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, there will be, in all likelihood, the quite contrary effect.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49802:53"/>
                  <p>For who is he, that will be forward to injure the Man, who, he ſees, is willing to be a Friend to all? And, if he hath injured him already, when he conſiders he hath injured ſo much Goodneſs, how will he caſt (as it were,) the firſt Stone at himſelf; be troubled at his fault, and endeavour to repair it, by a Submiſſive and Relenting Carriage?</p>
                  <p>But if the Offendor be Stubborn, and not ſo eaſily brought down, yet the Offended Man's Chriſtian and Charitable Deportment, without interruption continued, will ſurely at laſt melt him. To this end is that Precept, and the Reaſon of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20. <hi>If thine Enemy Hunger, Feed him; if he Thirſt, give him Drink; for, in ſo doing, thou ſhalt heap Coals of Fire upon his Head.</hi> It is a way of Speech alluding unto thoſe who are Melters of Metals; when a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is very hard they not only put Fire under it, but heap Coals upon it, and by this means, though hard to be Melted it be, yet at laſt it yields to the Fire.</p>
                  <p>So when to an Enemy, though of an obſtinate and moſt hardned Temper, a Chriſtian Love ſhall ſtill be ſhewn; and kindneſſes, upon good occaſions, be heaped upon his Head, He muſt be harder than Iron or Braſs who will not be ſenſible of them, and ſuffer his Evil to be overcome with Good.</p>

                  <p>But let us go to the Fourth thing, which they object againſt theſe Laws, viz. <hi>That they require the Macerating of the Body with Faſting and Abſtinence; which, what is it, but the making a Man Cruel to his own Fleſh?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49802:54"/>
                  <p>I freely acknowledge, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> That Faſting is a Chriſtian Duty; and that when our Lord ſaith, <hi>when thou Faſteſt enter into thy Cloſet,</hi> though it be not in the plain form of a Command, Thou ſhalt Faſt, yet it is not hereby the leſs a Command. And the reaſon is, becauſe our Saviour, from the frequent Practice of Faſting, and the great Credit which this Duty among the Jews was in, did ſuppoſe it to be a Duty. And by his Precepts for the right perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, he may well be preſum'd to enjoyn the thing. And therefore in his Sermon he ranks it with Prayer and Alms: Which Duties (and I may ſay, which Sermon too, as to every part of it,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Practice of Chriſtians, ſo long as the World ſtands.</p>
                  <p>But, wherein, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> is it that the harſhneſs of this Law of Faſting lies?</p>
                  <p>If our Bodies are apt (as too apt they are,) from conſtant Feeding, not to ſerve, but to rebel againſt the better part of us, our Souls; is it ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing to withdraw for a time their wonted Nouriſhment; that from them our Prayers and Praiſes may not be Drowſie: And our better thoughts not Clogg'd?</p>
                  <p>Or, if out of a Senſe of our own Unworthineſs, we ſhall ſomtimes lay aſide all our enjoyments; refuſing to Eat the Fat, and Drink the Sweet; that, in the ſight of God, we may acknowledge ourſelves leſs than the leaſt of his Mercies; (which ſure by reaſon of our continual Failings we too truly are,) what ſober Man can condemn us for ſo doing?</p>
                  <p>Or, laſtly, if we ſhall make a ſuitable Expreſſion of Repentance for ſome Sins, which have chiefly proceeded from the Body, by exerciſing upon it an holy Revenge, and denying it, for a ſeaſon, the things which are pleaſant; They muſt be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Men, who will ſay, That we do more than what is meet to be done.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49802:54"/>
                  <p>The Religions even of the Heathens have not been without their Abſtinences, as their <hi>Votivae no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes</hi> do teſtifie; and their Wiſe Men have addicted themſelves thereunto. Hence <hi>Lucilius</hi> is by <hi>Seneca</hi> exhorted to fare ſomtimes ſo hard, <hi>Liberaliora ut ſint alimenta Carceris,</hi> That the Diet of a Priſon ſhould exceed his. Nay, <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf (whom theſe Objectors againſt Chriſtianity are ſo willing to have their Maſter,) had his certain days, <hi>quibus malignè famem extingueret, nec toto aſſe paſceretur.</hi> Which things ſurely may teach Theſe Men not to condemn our Holy Religion, by reaſon of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence which it enjoyns; eſpecially ſince this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence is uſed for Ends ſo much higher than the other, and ſuch as are truly excellent.</p>
                  <p>So diſtant, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> are the Laws of Chriſt from the Imputation of Cruelty on the account of Faſting, that they allow us, ordinarily, the moderate Uſe, and, on Feſtival Days, whether Civil or Sacred, the more plentiful Enjoyment of Gods good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo far as they ſhall miniſter to an Innocent or Religious Chearfulneſs of Body and Soul. Nay, even in the very exerciſe of Faſting, our Bodies are not to be enfeebled, (as ſome Religious Mens of old were, whoſe Exceſſes this way will rather be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven than rewarded,) but only made ſuch as they ought to be, obedient to the Soul and to God. Yea, we thereby contribute to their Health and Welfare; which, by fulneſs of Bread, and exceſs of Wine, are too often deſtroyed. And, what is the chief thing of all, we, by ſo doing, provide that they ſhall hereafter, to their endleſs Happineſs, be Spiritual Bodies. If this be cruelty to ourſelves, I know not, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> what will be kindneſs. This is certain, that amidſt ſuch Acts of Mortification, there ariſeth a ſecret, but very great, Content and Satisfaction. He who hath truly tryed, knoweth it to be ſo.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49802:55"/>
                  <p>And then, for the Laſt Fault that they find with theſe Laws, <hi>viz. That they bind us to part with our Eſtates and Lives for the aſſerting our Religion, when meerly ſome outward Compliance, and a denying of ſome few things only, and this no otherwiſe than in ſhew for a time, would preſerve us; which, ſay they, is a hard ſaying, and who can bear it?</hi> We anſwer;</p>
                  <p>That we very ſeldom are brought to theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; our holy Religion ordinarily providing, that from the ſweetneſs of Nature, which it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to nouriſh amongſt Men, we ſhould enjoy both Eſtates and Lives with Peace and Safety.</p>
                  <p>But then, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> when our Lives and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are, in the uſual courſe of the World, ſo well by our Lawgiver deſigned; and Bleſſings in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are made known unto us, ſo much better than Life, and all the Enjoyments of it; Can it ſeem ſo hard a ſaying, that, in a ſeldom and ſpecial Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, we ſhould, to the loſs of Eſtate and even of Life itſelf, confeſs this Lawgiver, and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>Should our Lord have done ſo great things for us, and permitted us to affirm or deny them, as, from hopes or fears in this World, we ſhould ſee good, He himſelf would have been much wanting to the Religion he taught, and we might with ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have queſtioned the Truth of it, when its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was ſo little concerned for the Eſteem, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it ſhould have among Men. So that, in a right eſtimate of things, upon ſuppoſition that the Chriſtian Religion is true, our Lord could not, in Juſtice and Wiſdom have done leſs, than required the parting with Eſtate and Life for the maintaining of it.</p>
                  <p>And Theſe Men, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> however they ſtand ſo much upon their Lives and Incomes in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, will yet be forward enough to venture them
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49802:55"/> for the vindicating of their own Truth and Right; or for the aſſerting the Reputation of a Friend; in things, on either Hand, mean enough. And they'l think, that, in Generoſity, they are bound thus to do. Why then ſhould they ſo much ſhrink of their Courage, for the ſober and deliberate maintaining of Truth, and Priviledges, that ſo highly concern them; and of the Honour of their Lord, who hath been, and is, a Friend, beyond what the Friendſhip of all Men in the World, were it amaſs'd together, could amount unto? Indeed, were there an end of all Happineſs and Being, when this Life ſhould end, we could the leſs blame Men, if they, upon no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, would part with their Lives; and, upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, let go their Eſtates. But when Chriſtianity holds out a better Inheritance, and a better Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe, who ſhall be willing to become Poor, or to Dye for the Sake of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, there is more encouragement to hazard, yea, to loſe all, in this cauſe, than in the beſt cauſe the World affords beſide.</p>
                  <p>But, whereas it is urged, that when a mere out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Compliance, and a Denial only of ſome few things; and this, no otherwiſe than in Shew for a Time, would preſerve us, we are then unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably required to ſuffer; I would ask, What way there is to Confeſs our Lord and Aſſert our Religion before Men, beſides that of outward Geſtures and Words? For the Heart, Men cannot diſcern; and the Thoughts are beyond their Search. Where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is an External Compliance with thoſe that are Enemies to Chriſt, and we Say as they Say; and Do as they Do; we deny Chriſt before Men, as fully as we know how to do.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely the denying of only ſome things in our Holy Religion, cannot be thought to be made amends for, by other things being retain'd. For, by the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49802:56"/> ſame reaſon, that One part of Chriſtianity is denied, any Other part, or All, may in the like manner be ſo too.</p>
                  <p>Neither, let any one imagine that there can be a denying of Chriſt, which ſhall be only the Work <hi>of the Nerves and Muſcles,</hi> (as once a Jew ſaid his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of Chriſt was,) the <hi>Heart,</hi> in the mean time, <hi>not conſenting,</hi> and thereby continuing <hi>Sound.</hi> For the Heart muſt needs be Faulty and Falſe, when it ſhall ſuffer the Mouth to ſpeak Deceitful Things. Our Lords undiſſembled bearing of Poverty and Want, Scandals and Reproaches; and his moſt Faithful Suffering of the moſt Bitter and Accurſed Death for our Welfare, doth certainly deſerve, that, when good occaſion requires, we ſhould openly and fairly undergo the loſs of Earthly Enjoyments, and of Life itſelf, for his Honour: and, with the laſt drop of our Blood, bear witneſs to that Religion, for the Confirmation of which he ſhed his own moſt pretious Blood. This is the way for us to <hi>fill up</hi> that <hi>which is behind of the Sufferings of Chriſt, in our Fleſh.</hi> For none of his Sufferings for our <hi>Expiation</hi> are behind; Thoſe he hath wholly undergone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and no Man could joyn with him in them: But a room for our <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to the Truth of his Goſpel he hath left; and herein we can ſhare with him in his Sufferings. And this let us do, willing to loſe ſome few years to come, (which, were we free from Troubles, we, upon the Account of Mortality, could not be ſure of,) rather than caſt a blot upon all the years of our Life paſt. Yea, diſeſteeming this whole ſhort Life, and all the Pleaſures and Profits of it, in Compariſon of that Crown and Bliſs, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thoſe who are faithful unto Death. Though, truly, our Lord is very deſirous that our Lives ſhould be ſaved, rather than deſtroy'd, if, by any honeſt and upright means, they ſo can be. And
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49802:56"/> therefore he allows, yea commands us, if we <hi>be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in one City, to flee unto another;</hi> and, if with Integrity we can preſerve our Lives, by no means to loſe them.</p>
                  <p>However, let not this Command of our Lord, which requires us to part with Eſtates and Lives rather than deny him, be faulted as too rigid and hard, while the Rewards are ſo much beyond the Pains; and while ſo many of Thoſe, who have thus ſuffered, have had ſuch Aſſiſtances and Joys afforded them, even in the midſt of their Sufferings, that a Man would almoſt wiſh for their Sorrows, could he but have their Joys together with them. From all which it may appear, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that the Air (as was objected,) is not too pure to be breath'd in; and that they are not unreaſonable Heights of Duty which are required of us.</p>
                  <p>Neither may it diſturb us, that this our Work is not, without difficulty, to be begun, and, in like manner, for ſome time, to be carried on by us. For it is, in a ſort, a Priviledge which <hi>Angels</hi> have not, to teſtifie unto <hi>Pains,</hi> yea even <hi>unto Death itſelf,</hi> the Sincerity of Obedience. Which Teſtification of Sincerity, although it ariſeth from an Imperfection of Human Nature, will yet be very acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; poſſibly, no leſs than that of the Holy Ones Above, which is wholly free from all ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</p>
                  <p>And, while the chief Intent of our Lawgiver is to make us <hi>Pious</hi> towards God, <hi>Compoſed</hi> in our own Breaſts, <hi>Loving</hi> unto others, and <hi>Loved</hi> again by them; <hi>Perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect, who makes his Sun to riſe on the Evil and on the Good;</hi> and <hi>meting</hi> only the <hi>ſame meaſure</hi> to others, which hath firſt been meted, by the Love and Compaſſion of our Lord, unto us; we muſt, one would think, uſe very much Violence to the better Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49802:57"/> of our Souls, if we do not entirely love theſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>As for mine own part, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> (will you give me leave to ſpeak my Heart freely to you?) my Love is ſo great to them, that, methinks, I would obey them all, not ſo much becauſe I am commanded to do it, as becauſe they are every way in themſelves ſo worthy to be loved. I could wiſh, that they were even one with my Soul; and that all my Thoughts and Actions might proceed not more from Life, than from Them. And, ſo far would I be from queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the goodneſs of them, that I would as ſoon doubt, whether it were good to Live and be Happy. So dear are they unto me; yea, ſo much better than Life itſelf.</p>

                  <p>I am much prevail'd upon by the Reaſons you have given; and your laſt Affectionate Words add ſo much a further weight to thoſe Reaſons, that they appear to me not to be more the Iſſues of your Brain than of your Heart. And therefore you may, on good Grounds, preſume, that they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to others, when they have firſt been ſo to yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>But, though I acknowledge the Laws of our Lord to require moſt reaſonable things of us; and do find that they truly have an high place in my Eſteem and Love; yet I'll confeſs to you, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> much dejected I am ſomtimes, when I reflect upon my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Failures. Reſolve, indeed, I do, for the greateſt Care and Circumſpection, but yet my Sins do daily increaſe upon me; and what will it boot me to love theſe Laws, when every day I tranſgreſs them? To own them ſo admirably fitted for the perfecting of our Nature, and the refining of our Practiſe, when I ſee mine own Nature ſo imperfect under them, and my Practcie ſo impure in Compariſon of them?</p>

                  <p>What you now ſay, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> makes way for, and will beſt be anſwer'd, by the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration of the Fourth thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That from theſe Laws we have a fair way for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt perfect theſe Laws are, (as you have heard,) but by reaſon of that weakneſs, which is within us, and thoſe many ſtrong Temptations, which are without, they are not like to be perfectly obeyed. All that we can do, is, as it were, a great way off to behold and admire that perfection, which we cannot of ourſelves attain unto; and to grieve, that we daily and hourly, ſome way or other have Sinn'd againſt it.</p>
                  <p>But yet <hi>there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing,</hi> Our Bleſſed Lord knowing our frame and make; and ſeeing that our ſtrength and abilities are but ſmall, hath added two other Laws of Faith and Repentance, in which we may find ſome cheering, in reſpect of thoſe many Breaches of the Divine Laws, which lie as a weight upon our Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That of Faith</hi> requires thus much of us.</p>
                  <p>That we believe in Chriſt as a Saviour, who, by his precious Blood for us Shed, hath appeaſed Gods Wrath, and obtain'd Remiſſion for all the Sins of Men; and for ours, in that number. And from the mighty importance of this Law, and the infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits it affordeth unto us, the whole Goſpel, and all the Laws thereof, are, in a comprehenſive Word, called the <hi>Law of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, in this reſpect, it is much different from the Old Law. Perfect Obedience was required by That, and becauſe perfection of Obedience is neceſſarily grounded upon a perfection of Nature, the Law ſeemeth therefore to have been the Rule, not of our Works only, but of our Nature alſo; which at the Creation was committed pure into our Hands.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49802:58"/>
                  <p>But this Law of Faith, by reaſon of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures having <hi>been</hi> perfect in Chriſt, and having <hi>Done</hi> alſo, without the leaſt failure, whatſoever was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the Repreſentative of Mankind to do; and, as united with the Divine Nature, having <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> likewiſe what Puniſhment was Due to the Sins of Men; this Law, I ſay, of Faith doth Command that we ſhould not rely upon any Righteouſneſs of our own? not yet Deſpair for any Sin, whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to our Nature, or more particularly to our own Perſons; but ſhould have our Eyes upon Him, who alone, by his Merits, hath purchaſed Salvation for us.</p>
                  <p>The Law of Repentance is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we truly be ſorry for what Sins ſoever we commit; and do heartily endeavour an amendment of Life. And this ſhall be available, through the Death of Chriſt, for our Pardon.</p>
                  <p>Repentance ſhall not, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> be unto Sins, after the ſame manner, as Sacrifices in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law were. Not the ſmall Sins only ſhall be done away, but the great ones alſo ſhall no leſs. For he who hath called us unto Repentance, hath been a propitiation for all the Sins of Mankind alike; for thoſe of a deeper Dye, as well as thoſe of a lighter Stain: And his Blood is, againſt the greateſt Offences, and the ſmalleſt Infirmities, equally Efficacious. Of Old, if a Man had unwillingly Kill'd his Brother, and was truly ſorry for it, the avenger of Blood was, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, allowed to Slay him, if he could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him before he reach'd to the City of Refuge. The Sin here (if it were not rather an unhappineſs,) was ſo far imputed, as That he muſt dye for it, if another could run faſter than he; which might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be a thing beyond his power to prevent: And though this might ſtir up a dread of willful Murder, and a tender care to preſerve the Lives of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49802:58"/> others, by ſignifying the Blood of Man to be of ſo great account, that even He, who ſhed it againſt his will, was not to be eſteemed wholly innocent; it yet might ſeem to be very ſevere. But, under Chriſts Laws, the Sins which we truly repent of, ſhall not be reckoned to our account, merely for ſome accidental Occurrences, which we could not by any foreſight put by. Much leſs ſhall an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ignorance, or Errour, without a Sin, bring pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon us. No Sin is there, which Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will not obtain Forgiveneſs for, except one alone, and that is <hi>The Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which will never be forgiven, neither in this World, nor in that which is to come;</hi> neither under the Jewiſh State, nor the Goſpel Diſpenſation. And yet even This Sin (if now it can be committed, when the miraculous Demonſtration of the Spirit is ceaſed,) is not impardonable in Men ſo, as if Repentance, were it there, could not prevail for Remiſſion: But it is therefore impardonable, becauſe it is attended with an impenitent Obdurateneſs, and a perverſe Obſtinacy againſt the Means of Salvation, ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and evidently ſet forth unto them.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe words to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8.22. <hi>Repent of this thy Wickedneſs, if perhaps the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> ſhew not that St. <hi>Peter</hi> doubted whether the fault would be remitted, though there ſhould be true Repentance; but that the doubt was, whether the Repentance would be true or no. Or rather, that way of ſpeech imports the Apoſtle not as one that doubteth, but as one that encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a Sinner in a moſt difficult caſe to repent. And <hi>Eſau</hi>'s <hi>finding no place of Repentance,</hi> (Heb. 12.17.) <hi>though he ſought it carefully with Tears,</hi> doth by no means ſignifie that either <hi>himſelf</hi> did not repent, or that his true Repentance <hi>would not be accepted</hi> with God; (much leſs that any truly repentant under
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49802:59"/> the Goſpel may, in ſome caſes, fail of Forgiveneſs of his Sins;) But that he found no ſuch Repentance in his <hi>Father Iſaac,</hi> as to reverſe the Bleſſing, which, through miſtake, (but by God's eſpecial Providence ſo ordering it,) he had given to <hi>Jacob</hi> the younger Brother.</p>
                  <p>The Denying Repentance, as ſome Chriſtian Doctors in antient Times did, to thoſe who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after Baptiſm, did very ill commend the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Baptiſm unto Infants; who might ſeem thereby to be put into a more dangerous eſtate, than, had they not known the Font, they would have been; and it was a Severity which had no true warrant from our Lord, or his Apoſtles. And though the Primitive Church did not admit Adulterers, Idolaters, and Murtherers to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and alſo did utterly refuſe Thoſe, on their Death-bed, as unpardonable Offenders, who had lived wickedly all their Lives; yet ſhe called them unpardonable, not becauſe God would not forgive them, but becauſe it was <hi>in his Power alone</hi> to do it: There being no way (as ſhe thought,) left for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, through the Miniſtry of Eccleſiaſtick Perſons, to be had. Or, at leaſt, ſince Abſolution would have been, in ſome ſort, a warranting of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſhe thought it better not to grant it, in ſuch hazardous caſes, than not to ſatisfie herſelf in the doing it. But yet ſhe never thought, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Sin or Sins were, that there would not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a place for pardon, where there was a true and worthy Repentance.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who would not be cheered amidſt his dejectedneſs for Sins, from ſuch merciful Laws, as theſe are? Who would not love the Laws, which allow ſuch eaſie Terms for Pardon and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? If <hi>our Lawgiver had required ſome great thing of us, would we not have done it?</hi> How much more,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49802:59"/> when he commands ſuch equal and reaſonable things as theſe are?</p>

                  <p>What you ſpeak, I have, with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, obſerved in more than a few. Some are very willing to think, ſince their Own Righteouſneſs is not to be relied upon, but Chriſts Merits alone to be truſted in, that therefore, if they do but <hi>Believe,</hi> it is no matter how they <hi>Live.</hi> And, as if Obedience were not a neceſſary thing, they have urged thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>viz. That the Law, which was Engraven in Stones, is done away;</hi> which, ſay they, muſt be meant of the Moral Law; That alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, which was Written in the Tables of Stone.</p>
                  <p>And then, for Repentance; if they Exerciſe that, many years hence; yea, though it be but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Death, they'l perſuade themſelves it is time enough. The <hi>Thief</hi> while <hi>on the Croſs;</hi> and the <hi>Labourers</hi> at the <hi>Eleventh Hour</hi> were accepted.</p>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> how little would the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the Laws of Faith and Repentance be, if they ſhould make way for ſuch unworthy Practice? And to what purpoſe are there ſo many other Laws given by the Son of God, if the Obſervance of them be of ſo little Moment? Surely, unleſs the Enemy of God and all Goodneſs, be taken into Conſultation, it can never be thought, that, when Mankind was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable by reaſon of their Sin, Chriſt Jeſus ſhould in ſuch a wonderful manner leave the Glory of Heaven and Shed his moſt precious Blood, to <hi>this End, viz.</hi> That they might without <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>danger, commit Sin;</hi> and with the <hi>greater aſſurance and confidence continue in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They willingly are ignorant, that Chriſt Dyed to Vindicate the <hi>Authority of the Divine Law,</hi> which they had Violated; and that therefore it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more carefully to be obey'd.</p>
                  <p>They are very ready not <hi>to rely upon their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> but they little conſider that the not Relying upon it, doth ſuppoſe that Righteouſneſs there is to be, on which they muſt not rely; and that they ſhould be as careful to practiſe it, as they are forward not to rely upon it. Otherwiſe, it would be the Practiſing of Wickedneſs, rather than their not Relying on their own Righteouſneſs; which are as far different, as the being humbly Religious, is from the being audaciouſly Profane.</p>
                  <p>Nor, doth their <hi>Truſting in Chriſt's Merits</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>done</hi> and <hi>ſuffered</hi> what they were to do and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, procure them a Pardon of their Sins, ſo, as they may ſtill perſiſt to be Sinful. All Sins ſhall be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for which, under the Law ſtrictly conſidered, there was no Hope; but not abſolutely pardon'd, without any further Conſideration or Condition. The great benefit of Faith is this; to wit, <hi>That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of perfect Obedience, our ſincere Endeavours ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49802:60"/> be accepted.</hi> And where <hi>Theſe</hi> are, what Defects ſoever there be in us, they ſhall all be made up by the Merits of Chriſt, <hi>who is our Righteouſneſs.</hi> But no benefit is there to be expected, if we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not at all, or be unſincere in our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle's words, That the <hi>Law which was engraven in Stones is done away,</hi> are to be underſtood of the Law as it was part of the <hi>Covenant with the Jews,</hi> not as it was <hi>a Rule for all Men.</hi> In that it was the Law of Nature, and written in the Hearts of Men, before it was written in Tables, it ſtill obligeth, and for ever will oblige, to Obedience. Nor can any one, unleſs he hath bidden a Farewel to all Reaſon, imagine that our Lord would bring the Moral Law into the Goſpel, delivering it in greater plainneſs, and raiſing it to an higher Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that, after all, Mens Obedience thereunto ſhould not be neceſſary; or that Faith in <hi>Him, who came to deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> ſhould give a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the practiſing thoſe Works.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort; <hi>Faith,</hi> though but a ſingle word it be, is yet an highly comprehenſive one, and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mighty things in it; Such as, in good ſort, do correſpond to the infinite and wonderful Love which hath been ſhewn to Mankind. It implyeth a <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the great Myſtery of our Redemption: A <hi>Cloſing</hi> with the Will of God, which is holy and good: A <hi>ſober and right uſe of Reaſon:</hi> A <hi>Couragious aſſerting</hi> of our Holy Religion againſt all Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: An <hi>unfeigned Love</hi> both to God and to Men, with a <hi>deep ſenſe</hi> of our Unworthineſs, and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Acknowledgment</hi> of our owing all to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bounty. Who are they then can think, that if they do but <hi>believe,</hi> it's no matter <hi>how</hi> they <hi>live?</hi> And from which of all theſe Actions (which make up the very <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi>) is there ſo much as the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49802:61"/> leaſt Countenance to a looſe Converſation? Nay, there cannot be ſtronger Obligations to a <hi>Sober, Righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Godly Life,</hi> than Theſe are; and in the exerciſe of them, this <hi>Sober, Righteous, and Godly Life</hi> doth conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>And how, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> can any <hi>wreſt</hi> Repentance for Sin to the <hi>further</hi> and <hi>more ſafe committing of Sin?</hi> Shall the Example of the <hi>Thief on the Croſs,</hi> which was written for Mens Comfort, adminiſter to their Preſumption? They conſider not the Eminency of that poor Malefactor's Faith, from which his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance did ſpring. It is not altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that this was the firſt Opportunity he had of believing in Chriſt. However, the time of his believing, and hoping for Mercy, was very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. That when our Lord was in Torments as well as he, and was deſtitute of all Earthly Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, He <hi>Then</hi> ſhould be ſought unto: When he was forſaken of his Diſciples, derided by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and reviled by the other Thief, as one juſtly ſuffering; That <hi>Then</hi> he ſhould be acknowledged as a Lord; That <hi>Then</hi> he ſhould be own'd, and his Mercy thus begg'd, <hi>Lord, have Mercy upon me when thou comeſt in thy Kingdom,</hi> was a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Act of Faith, and a Repentance very much heightned from the time in which it was begun and finiſhed.</p>
                  <p>But can Theſe, who have been Baptized into Chriſt's Death, and have given up their Names unto him, as ſoon almoſt as they were born, and this, with Solemn Vows of <hi>Fighting Manfully under his Banner, againſt the World, the Fleſh and the Devil;</hi> Can <hi>Theſe</hi> ſay, That ſome of the <hi>Laſt Days</hi> of their Life are the <hi>Firſt Opportunities</hi> they have had of that Faith, which muſt give Life to their Repentance? Should they ſay it, the many outward Calls they have had by God's bleſſed Word read and heard; the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49802:61"/> many inward Calls of his Holy Spirit, moving them to their Duty; the many Checks of Conſcience they have felt in their ſinful and unchriſtian Practices, would be ready to contradict them to their Face.</p>
                  <p>And then, <hi>for the Time,</hi> (though they ſhould be as near their End as the Thief was,) the caſe with <hi>Theſe</hi> and with <hi>Him</hi> is very different.</p>
                  <p>No Hour is there now, but, in it, it may be ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt is riſen from the Dead; Aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> hath <hi>given Gifts unto Men;</hi> and hath had <hi>all Power given unto him;</hi> and of theſe things we have had as great Proofs as can reaſonably be deſired: Which makes the Encouragements of turning unto Chriſt now, <hi>to</hi> be <hi>far greater,</hi> than in that <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>diſmal State of his Paſſion</hi> on the Croſs they were.</p>
                  <p>Unleſs Theſe Men could be put in the <hi>ſame</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with the Thief; or in ſome not <hi>altogether unlike</hi> unto his; which cannot likely be, (while they ſhall thus from the means of Salvation, contrive for their Sins;) there will be ſmall hopes for them in their late Repentance.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Thoſe,</hi> who wrought in the Vineyard <hi>no ſooner than the Eleventh Hour,</hi> and yet were reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike with the Earlieſt, it is to be underſtood of thoſe who were <hi>called</hi> no ſooner, as is evident from <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.6.7. About <hi>the Eleventh Hour he went out, and found others ſtanding idle: And ſaith unto them, why ſtand you idle?</hi> They ſay unto him, <hi>becauſe no Man bath Hired us;</hi> where by <hi>Hiring</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Calling;</hi> which Calling may have reſpect either unto <hi>ſingle Perſons,</hi> or elſe <hi>Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe Perſons who have not heard of the Goſpel; or have not had opportunities of underſtanding the Myſteries and Precepts of it, if, as ſoon as they are acquainted with them, and are invited to give their Names unto Chriſt, they ſhall ſincerely do it;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49802:62"/> though it be in reſpect of their Lives, as the Eleventh Hour to the Day, they ſhall not be refuſed.</p>
                  <p>And the like may be ſaid of <hi>Nations,</hi> even at the later end of the World; They ſhall be as dear in the ſight of God as thoſe which have had earlier calls.</p>
                  <p>But the Receiving a Penny at the Ninth and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Hour is not to be underſtood of Them, who, having been Baptized in their Infancy, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly profeſſing Chriſtianity all along, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the practice of it till their laſt years.</p>
                  <p>For, they were (as I may ſo ſpeak,) <hi>Hired at the firſt Hour;</hi> and have <hi>idled</hi> it ever ſince. And their Idleneſs is to be eſteem'd much different from that of the other. The other wrought not, becauſe as yet they had no Imployment, nor place in the Vineyard; But Theſe had Imployment and Place in it, and were Unfaithful and Truanty: And ſo may expect Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for their early and continued neglect, while the other ſhall have a full Reward for their late Labour; late indeed, yet as early as their Call.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſay, but the late Obedience of thoſe who have been early called, may ſometimes be ſincere; and, in Mercy, accepted by God. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture accounts of it as a thing not ordinary, and, as it were, out of the uſual courſe. Let us except that one inſtance of the Thief on the Croſs, which is to be looked upon as a ſpecial and un-common Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (and therefore it ſtands by itſelf in the whole Book of God:) And we ſhall find the Goſpel to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in the uſual Current of it, Eternal Rewards to that Obedience only, which hath Perſeverance joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; and which <hi>laſts unto,</hi> not <hi>begins at,</hi> the <hi>end of Life. He that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and, <hi>be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi>

                  <p>They not only encline me to grieve for theſe miſerable Men, who are ſo much their own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but do alſo give me a pleaſure in conceiving theſe inſtances of Holy Writ (mentioned by you,) more fully, and to better advantage, than before I did.

                  <p>I am ſure, Theſe Laws of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are well worthy our Love, as for the Excellence of their Effects, ſo for the Sacredneſs of their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What an inward pleaſure is it to conceive the Son of God, leaving the Glory of Heaven, to live upon Earth, and become one among the Sons of Men! How may it engage all the Powers of the Soul into a Divine Love, while we contemplate him in in the Garden, ſweating, as it were, great drops of Blood; and ſhedding afterwards the remainder thereof upon the Croſs, amidſt bitter pains for our Sake! This is, indeed, <hi>in itſelf,</hi> matter of the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kind; But, in <hi>reſpect of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> what Wonder and Joy may it not excite! But then, if we by Faith look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Lord as he is Aſcended into Heaven, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Manſions for us; and as he ſhall come again in the Clouds with great Glory, that where He is, there We may be alſo; with what an Holy Splendour will
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49802:63"/> our underſtandings be entertain'd! Men are uſually taken with great things; State, and Grandeur, though ſuch in appearance only, draw the Eyes of the moſt; if really ſuch they be, and do carry in them true Worth, (as here they eminently do,) they engage the Hearts alſo of the Wiſe and the Good.</p>
                  <p>Truly, our Faith, from the Sweet and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter it is fraught with, may <hi>well work by Love;</hi> Love, not only to God and Men, but even to the Law likewiſe by which it is enjoyn'd.</p>
                  <p>Such Majeſty, as is included in our Faith, is not, I confeſs, to be found in Repentance; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly in thoſe Actions, that are Humble and Lowly. But how comely is it that an offending Soul ſhould be humbled before an offended God; who, at ſuch Submiſſion and Sorrow, condeſcends, and accepts it with the greateſt Love! A Face which hath ſo Holy a Sadneſs in it, and is wet with ſuch Religious Tears, cannot but appear amiable: Yea, even to the Perſon who thus repenteth, there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſecret Satisfaction in the midſt of Sorrow; and it is none of the leaſt Chearings to him, that he can grieve, in earneſt, for his Sins againſt ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Father.</p>
                  <p>And thus much, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> may ſuffice for the Conſideration of the Laws themſelves: And if (like Thoſe, who walking over pleaſant Fields and flowery Meads, as not content alone with Delights in the Way, will look back, and bring into one proſpect, what ſucceſſively, and by parts, did ſo much pleaſe them,) we ſhall turn our Eyes back upon theſe Laws, and behold them in the Bulk, which ſingly were ſo excellent, they will afford us a new Delight in the Review. There is none of them that is unſuty and diſagreeing to another. They are not like that Face, whoſe Features by themſelves were beauteous,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49802:63"/> but united were uncomely; but they are ſuch, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe each others Luſtre, and ſhew a Symmetry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Divine.</p>

                  <p>It is ſo, <hi>Eubulus.</hi> When I conſider the Laws which require Duties to God, I am the more in love with thoſe which enjoyn my Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men. And when I weigh thoſe that relate to others and myſelf, thoſe towards God appear more advantageouſly to me; and I preſently am excited to put them into practice, by reverencing, loving, and praiſing Him, who hath given ſuch Laws unto us. Every <hi>particular Precept</hi> towards God, towards Men, towards myſelf, enkindles my Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reſt; and they <hi>Altogether,</hi> do highly ſet off, and commend to my Love, every Particular.</p>
                  <p>And this our Love to the Divine Law is not like our Love in many other caſes; which, when we recollect ourſelves, and betake us to ſerious Thoughts, goes leſs. For the gaining Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and eſteem, no need is there of thoſe Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that the Religious Inſtitutions, among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, had; which from Hieroglyphicks, Fables, pompous and divers Superſtitions, were ſerved up rather to the Imaginative Faculty, than to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and made to pleaſe not the Wiſe ſo much, as the Multitude. The Chriſtian Laws fear not the moſt piercing and critical Eyes looking into them; They diſcovering the greateſt Excellency to him, who hath the quickeſt Sight, and profoundeſt Judgment, joyn'd with an Upright Mind. And therefore our Love to them gets new Strength from Conſideration, as having Right Reaſon for a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; from which, like an Houſe built upon a Rock, it may ſtand ſtrongly, and not be caſt down nor abated, for any Wind or Waters that may come againſt it.</p>

                  <p>And truly, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> I find it a very great
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49802:64"/> Inducement for the raiſing our Love to theſe Laws, that They, of themſelves, are grievous unto none; but, as the <hi>Manna</hi> was, are, in a ſort, fitted to every Palate, unleſs to thoſe that are grievouſly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated. Who is it, that ever had juſt cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent he had yielded Obedience to them? To whom, in the exerciſe, do they not bring Content and Satisfaction? If at any time they ſeem to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Trouble to a Man, it is rather becauſe others trangreſs them, than becauſe he himſelf obſerveth them: A thing which cannot be ſaid of other Laws. Some of thoſe which are profitable for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are not ſo for ſome particular Men; who, for the publick Good, muſt be content to bear ſome private Inconveniences; and ſome, advantageous to a few Perſons, may not be ſo to a Nation in general.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there any thing, in its own Nature truly Good, which is <hi>omitted</hi> in their Injunctions; nor any thing, in its own Nature truly Evil, <hi>forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> in their Prohibitions. Nor can there be any the leaſt occaſion (as in the wiſeſt Human Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſomtimes there is,) for ſecond Thoughts to add any thing unto, or alter any thing in them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> if we conſider the Laws of our Lord, as they have relation only to <hi>Civil Society,</hi> and the Welfare of Men in this World, how far do they ſurpaſs thoſe of the moſt noted Lawgivers!</p>
                  <p>We find not among his Laws any that look like that of <hi>Solon;</hi> which required that <hi>All, in Publick Seditions, ſhould run and joyn with the juſter Part;</hi> and ordered that, <hi>if any did not ſo, be ſhould for ever after be infamous.</hi> For, when ſpecious Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould make (as very often they do,) the Worſt Side, to the Many, look fairer than that which is is really the Better, and every one muſt of neceſſity take his Sword into his Hand; what a Flame would
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49802:64"/> there, hereby, be blown up in a Commonwealth, without any probable means left of quenching it, but by large Effuſion of Blood! So that <hi>Plutarch</hi> might well call this a ſingular and altogether New Law; nor would the good Intent out-weigh the ſad Conſequences of it, had it upon occaſion been faithfully put in practice.</p>
                  <p>He doth not inſtitute, with <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> That <hi>Youth from Hardſhips of Education ſhould be inured to Thieve for their Meat;</hi> and ſhould be commended, if they could do it cunningly, and without being found out: An ill Foundation ſurely for Honeſty in greater Matters to be built upon, when they ſhould be Men.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth he, with <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Republick,</hi> take away a <hi>Fatherly Affection</hi> and <hi>Filial Duty,</hi> by <hi>indulging a Community of Women.</hi> Nor hath he any Law like that of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns <hi>That Lame and Deformed Children ſhould be caſt out, and not ſuffer'd to live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, as none of our Lords Laws are, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, evil, or of bad conſequence to Society, (as theſe now mention'd, and others that might be mentioned, are;) ſo, if any Law of his ſhall, by Craft, and an ill Mind, be made injurious unto any, there are other Laws, which come in for a <hi>right bounding</hi> of ſuch a Law; and do allow no room for Guile and Fraud to work upon. If any ſhall, on purpoſe to our wrong, make uſe of the Law that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, <hi>If a Man ſmite us on one Cheek, to turn the other;</hi> or of that which bids us <hi>Give to every one that asketh of us; and, of him, that taketh away our Goods, not to ask them again,</hi> (which Laws are, in a ſignal manner, deſigned for the eſtabliſhing of Peace and Charity,) there are Laws that ſecure theſe to a <hi>Rational Practice,</hi> by telling theſe Men, That <hi>Whatſoever they would, (i. e.</hi> in Right Reaſon would,) <hi>that Men ſhould do unto them, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49802:65"/> ſhould do the ſame to others:</hi> And by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ourſelves to call the <hi>Serpents Wiſdom</hi> to the <hi>Doves Innocence.</hi> Had there been ſuch Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made, by the <hi>Athenian Lawgiver,</hi> for the right limiting of his Law, which <hi>required the Cancelling of all Obligations and Debts paſt,</hi> That, which was well intended for the Relief of the Poor, had not proved ſo great an Oppreſſion to others, as it did. The Fraud of many had been prevented; and the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his own Juſtice had not been hurt.</p>
                  <p>Neither do our Saviours Laws fit us only for one State of Life, and render us altogether unapt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; as it is obſerved <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s did. They ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded chiefly to make the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> able for War; and were ſo ill conſtituted for Peace, that when That People were free from Enemies abroad, they quickly declined at home; not ſo much by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reach of good Laws, as by the Want of them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the Laws of Chriſt do chiefly promote and eſtabliſh Peace; and do admirably provide againſt thoſe Vices that are the attendants of Peace; as Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, Sloth, Wantonneſs, and ſuch like; but yet, they no leſs inſtruct us to a right Deportment in Troubleſom Times. And, moreover, when a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Cauſe puts a Sword into a Chriſtian's Hand, they teach him a Valour beyond that of other Men. A Valour which ſhall not owe itſelf to a Paſſion, that overwhelms conſideration; but which ſhall be firm, and well-grounded; from an aſſured hope that God will either give ſucceſs unto him here, or will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him after Death.</p>
                  <p>Whence <hi>Machiavel</hi> ſurely had ſmall reaſon to reflect upon the Chriſtian Laws, as thoſe, which, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much Meekneſs, and Patience, indiſpoſed Men for great undertakings; which, according to him, could not be accompliſhed without ſomthing of Cruelty. And he ill-affirm'd the Religions of Old
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49802:65"/> to fit Men better for mighty Actions, as accuſtoming them, by the Multitude of Sacrifices, to Blood and Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if high Enterprizes did neceſſarily include a ſhare of Inhumanity in them, what this Man ſays might the better be attended unto. But if thoſe actions only are truly Noble, in which Courage is regulated by Reaſon, and adorned with Juſtice and Temperance, how falſe and diſingenuous an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation he faſtens on the Laws of Chriſtianity, I need not ſay.</p>

                  <p>The Laws of our Lord are indeed ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, as that they highly promote the Welfare of Society in this World, by eſtabliſhing all thoſe publick Virtues, without which the publick Good could not ſubſiſt. The more deplorable than it is, that any, who are Chriſtians, ſhould, from any words of our Lord or his Apoſtles, take up and nouriſh Opinions that tend to the diſturbance of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Society. Two Opinions eſpecially there are, that do it; which too many have been, and are, very ready to entertain, the one is,</p>
                  <p>That <hi>whatever Right a Man hath to what he enjoys, he hath it only by inward Holineſs and Virtue:</hi> Or, in a Word, That <hi>all Dominion is founded in Grace;</hi> and this they infer from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.31, 32. <hi>All are yours; whether the World, things preſent, or things to come, all are yours.</hi> And hence if they have an high Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their own Sanctity, and a very low one of ſome other Mens, they can eaſily perſuade themſelves to take as their own, what the other have no juſt Title unto. By which means, Righteouſneſs and Honeſty, which are the great Eſtabliſhers of Society, are, as to theſe Perſons, deſtroyed; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Society itſelf diſturb'd.</p>
                  <p>The other Opinion (which for its illneſs may well be ranked with the now mention'd,) is this, <hi>That
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49802:66"/> Sovereign Princes may be Reſiſted, in the Defence and Maintenance of True Religion; as being that which is dearer than Life, and muſt by no means be with parted.</hi> And hence, (beſides when Religion is really ſtruck at,) if any Perſons be diſaffected to their Prince, it is eaſie to pretend, that he is no friend to Religion; that he cares not which way it goes; and, unleſs timely means be uſed, all will be loſt: And ſo Wars and Fightings ariſe, and the publick welfare is miſerably diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>Whether through <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> or an <hi>Evil Heart,</hi> theſe Opinions are embraced, I am ſure, the Laws of our Lord are no way chargeable with them.</p>
                  <p>If we look upon the Apoſtle's Words, from which the former Opinion is taken, to wit, <hi>All things are yours;</hi> there are theſe things indeed, which much make for the Honour, as well as the Benefit of Pious Men. All things are theirs, ſo, as that with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty they may uſe them, without eſteeming any of them unclean. All things are theirs, after ſuch a manner, as that if they ſhould abſolutely ſtand in need of them, God would order them, by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, for their Service. Laſtly, all things are ſo theirs, that, in probability God would not ſuffer his Sun to ſhine, nor his Rain to fall on the Evil, were there not Good Men in the World to value his Providence and Love. But then this is the whole, that thoſe Words will bear. To ſay, that God hath given the Saints the Right of Poſſeſſion, and authorized them to Ingroſs all the World to themſelves, is notoriouſly falſe. For, as the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the World now ſtands, God doth diſpoſe of the poſſeſſion of things, in thoſe ways, which all Civil Nations do give conſent unto, or the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws of Nations allow of; whether they be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances by Deſcent; or the Gift of others to us;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49802:66"/> or Purchaſed by our Money; or Acquired by our Labour: Where any of theſe are, there is a Right, as being God's Gifts to us by thoſe Methods; and the depriving us of them by Fraud or Force, would be down-right Injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, that the Right of Poſſeſſion, in theſe ways, is <hi>diſcernable</hi> and <hi>certain,</hi> while the founding it in Grace and Holineſs gives no <hi>ſure Light unto us at all.</hi> For how ſhall we know, who are the Good? We ſee Impiety can wear as good a Face ſomtimes as the trueſt Virtue; and Mens Hypocriſie may cheat not only others by a ſpecious ſhew, but even themſelves too. There is nothing (I may ſay,) more in the dark than true Goodneſs; we cannot be infallible in pronouncing it in another, becauſe his Heart and Thoughts, in which it peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, cannot be ſeen by us: And our own Hearts are ſo deceitful, that they oftentimes no leſs lie hid to ourſelves, than they do to others. And therefore, if Grace and Holineſs, which they will have to be the Ground of Dominion and Poſſeſſion, is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, That Right, which from thoſe is ſo much talk'd of, muſt needs be as uncertain.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe, that ſuch and ſuch ſhould be known undoubtedly to be Religious and Gratious Perſons; I would ask, Have they all the ſame Right to enjoy every thing, or have they not? If they have, there will this abſurdity follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That every one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the ſame time uſe what every one hath a Right unto; and Quarrels may ariſe, who ſhall have the Precedence in them. If they have not all the ſame Right, how comes equal Grace in many, to give an unequal Title? A narrower to one than to another? Or, if it ſhall evidently prove, (as it evidently will,) that Human Laws or Cuſtoms, and not Grace, do make a Diſtinction of Property, why ſhould ſome others, whom thoſe Laws or Cuſtoms
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49802:67"/> have by no means condemned, be denied the benefit of Property from them?</p>
                  <p>Further yet, God may poſſibly beſtow theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good things upon a wicked Man, as <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi> to a better courſe of Life: Somtimes he may throw them upon him as a <hi>Scourge;</hi> and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he may think good to <hi>reward</hi> with the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Earth, <hi>ſome good Actions in him;</hi> when yet his Crimes will not ſuffer him to have hereafter a place in Heaven. And in which of all theſe caſes, have not wicked Men a Right to their Eſtates from God, as well as from Men? Will any good Man think, that he hath any Title to thoſe outward Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, which God hath conferr'd to draw Men unto Virtue? Or will he arrogate to himſelf as Bleſſings what God hath made Curſes to others? Or laſtly, ſhall the good things which God hath given, as Rewards for ſome commendable Actions, be thought much of, envied, and claimed, when, it may be, they are all the Recompences which ever ſhall be given? And what wicked Man is there to whom his Eſtate may not belong in one of theſe ways? And ſurely to deprive him of it upon the account of Grace in ourſelves, or Corrupt Nature in him, would be Impiety and Preſumption towards God, and Injuſtice and Diſhoneſty towards Man. So unreaſonable, and contrary to the Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is this <hi>firſt</hi> Opinion.</p>
                  <p>And is it, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> any otherwiſe with the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond?</hi> I do not know any Laws in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that are more expreſs and direct than thoſe againſt the Reſiſting of Sovereign Princes. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God: Whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God; and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation,</hi> Rom. 13. And, were it that upon the account of Religion we might
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49802:67"/> reſiſt, why ſhould the Holy Ghoſt ſo peremptorily forbid Reſiſtence under an Emperour, who he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew would be a grievous Perſecutor of the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>But if we look at the firſt progreſs of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into the World, the caſe will be evident. The Goſpel was not forcibly to enter the Territories of any Prince; but, by its own Excellence, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with cogent Arguments, and humble Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was to have admittance. For indeed it was againſt the Nature of that which conſiſteth chiefly in Love, to thruſt itſelf upon the World by Acts of Hoſtility and Violence. And if ſo, can we reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably think, that, when it is admitted, it is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain itſelf by the Sword, againſt thoſe, through whoſe Favour and Kindneſs it was firſt received? This would be to make it by continuance to put on quite a different Nature from what it primarily had. And, were it to be ſuch, Princes could the leſs be blamed, if they ſhould be ſcrupulous in giving within their Dominions a place to that, which, at laſt, might not allow a place to themſelves there. But ſurely Chriſt's Kingdom, in its proper Nature, is <hi>as little of this World</hi> as <hi>ever it was,</hi> and ſo his Servants are as <hi>little to fight now,</hi> as they were, when <hi>He was upon the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a very remarkable place in St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.10, 11. where it is ſaid, That <hi>God will chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe unto the Day of Judgment, who are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities:</hi> And that <hi>the holy Angels, which are greater in Power and Might, bring not railing Accuſations againſt them;</hi> which muſt needs be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>evil Princes:</hi> For what occaſion may there ſeem for railing Accuſations againſt thoſe Princes, that are Pious and Good? Now, if the bleſſed Angels, with reſpect to God's Ordinance in them, will ſpeak with a kind of Heavenly Modeſty and Deference
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49802:68"/> concerning them, is it lawful for us, think we, not only to let looſe our Tongues in a bitter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing manner, but to lift up our Hands in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Rebellions againſt them? And if thoſe ſhall be <hi>reſerved unto the Great Day,</hi> for more than ordinary Damnation, who do only <hi>ſpeak evil</hi> of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, what Flames will be thought hot enough for thoſe, who dare with Swords make <hi>Reſiſtence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Religion is juſtly <hi>more dear</hi> unto us than <hi>our Lives;</hi> but that it is ſo, is to be ſhewn by the Obedience which it enjoyns, rather than by the Force which it condemns. For to aſſert the Goſpel by breaking the Precepts of it, is the being true to it in the ways of Falſeneſs; which is no better than bringing the Devils Aid into the Cauſe of God.</p>

Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>was dead,</hi> and <hi>is alive,</hi> and for ever will live; but alſo becauſe he was Author of Eternal Life, and made it the Reward of Obedience to his Laws.</p>
                  <p>And when our Lord ſhall purchaſe our poor Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience at ſo exceſſive a Value, as the giving of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the Glory thereof, (when he might juſtly command more Rigorous Services, without any Rewards further than merely our having of Life, and being preſerved while we do them,) what a mighty motive is it for Obedience to theſe Laws, and for our Love to them alſo!</p>
                  <p>Mean is the <hi>being Bleſſed in the City and in the Field;</hi> in reſpect of the Happineſs <hi>that Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, and that hath not ent'red into the Heart of Man to conceive.</hi> To have <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> and all <hi>Joys</hi> attending it, ſo that with Improved Souls, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bodies, we cannot wiſh them to be greater, nor fear them to be leſs; <hi>Joys,</hi> muſt ſutably follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Vertuous Life: and ſo refin'd and ſacred that they are worthy of an Immortality, for the being poſſeſs'd; how much doth it ſurpaſs a Life's being long in an Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and thoſe more common and ſenſible Bleſſings that were given to it?</p>
                  <p>Though yet theſe Earthly Rewards are not wholly excluded by the Heavenly neither; but when they ſhall be expedient for us, we ſhall have them. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49802:71"/> Bleſſings under the Goſpel, do aſſure us of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, ſo far forth as they ſhall be for our Good; as Temporal, under the Moſaick Law, did preſignifie Eternal ones that ſhould follow. <hi>For he that ſpared not his own Son but gave him for us all, How ſhall be not in Him freely give us all things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And herein, upon much better ground are we pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced than Thoſe were, who made <hi>Virtue to be its own Reward,</hi> and would have Men, even in the midſt of Torments, though there were no hope of an Allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to think that they had a ſufficiency of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from <hi>it</hi> alone. This was high and magnificent Talk indeed; and if (ſecure from ever being put into Practice,) it might have reſted in Speculation only, Virtue would not have been diſcredited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But ſmall Comfort it carried with it, when Pains and Troubles were actually to be undergone. And a Man, on the Rack, might almoſt be thought not un-wiſe, if for the obtaining of eaſe he would let go ſuch an Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>For more commended, ſurely, is the obſervance of the Laws of Chriſt, (which includeth in it all ſorts of Virtue.) Our Obedience is indeed to be maintain'd, if occaſion there were, even to the loſs of all Earthly Enjoyments; but then, <hi>it</hi> often in this World hath Plenty and Honour as its Attendants and Reward: Or, if it ſo ſhall be, that God in his Wiſdom ſhall ſuffer <hi>it</hi> on every Hand to be encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd with Afflictions, <hi>it</hi> yet hath ſomthing to ſuſtain it, beſides the meer reflecting upon itſelf; to wit, the aſſurance, that however <hi>its</hi> condition, at the preſent, be ſtrait and difficult, it will not always be ſo. God can, and it may be, he will, give Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eaſe here; but if this he ſhall not do, there ſhall certainly after Death be Joys ſufficient; when theſe ſhort Troubles ſhall be abundantly made up by an Happineſs which never ſhall have an end. And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49802:71"/> this may afford a firm ſupport to Virtue, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a Cheerfulneſs even in the <hi>Valley of the Shadow of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who is it then that can refuſe Obedience to the Laws of our Lord, when he thus brings <hi>Life and Immortality to Light,</hi> and promiſeth them as Rewards to our Obedience? And if the Excellency of the Laws themſelves will not prevail upon the Man for his Love, how can he ſtand out againſt the Happineſs that attendeth them?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Chriſtians, that endeavour to put far from them <hi>this Happineſs,</hi> by eſteeming the Obedience to be <hi>Low</hi> and <hi>Mercenary,</hi> which hath reſpect to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I very much <hi>pity;</hi> as being ſuch, who, through <hi>ſad error,</hi> deny to themſelves the greateſt comfort of their Life; but very much <hi>blame</hi> them alſo, in that, as much as in them lies, they deveſt the Holy Laws of their Ineſtimable Ornament; and would take from us <hi>the Joy that is ſet before us;</hi> which was the great ſupport to our Lord, in his <hi>enduring the Croſs, and deſpiſing the Shame,</hi> and ſo may juſtly be an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> in the doing of his Will: Eſpecially, ſince, by reaſon of our Weakneſs and Imperfection, we have little reaſon to let go what may ſo ſtrongly excite us unto, and ſo ſweetly confirm us in, our Duty.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> for the further ſecuring of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to theſe Laws, there are <hi>Eternal Puniſhments</hi> after Death, threatned to the Diſobedient. <hi>It is better,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>to enter into Life Maimed, than having two Hands to go into Hell, into the Fire that never ſhall be quenched: Where their Worm dieth not, and where their Fire is not quenched.</hi> There being a <hi>Worm to Gnaw</hi> the Man, declareth that there <hi>is Torment;</hi> and there being a worm not failing nor dying, declareth the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of <hi>the Torment;</hi> there being a <hi>Fire to burn</hi> denoteth <hi>pain;</hi> and there being a Fire not

                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner are we to underſtand thoſe Words of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 25.46. <hi>They ſhall go into Everlaſting Puniſhment; i. e.</hi> They ſhall go into that which ſhall never ceaſe, nor have end. The Law of Old did indeed, in its ſtricteſt conſtitution, affix a <hi>Curſe</hi> (to wit, Death,) <hi>upon every one that continued not in all things Written therein to do them.</hi> But yet that Rigour was ſo far Mitigated, that, when leſs Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were allowed for ſome Sins, <hi>Luſtings,</hi> though ſtill forbidden, might ſeem to have no Penalty at all impoſed; or elſe were thought to be wip'd off in Courſe, by the Daily Sacrifices. Hereupon it was that the Jews, if they could abſtain from outward Miſcarriages, were little concerned for inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude; a freedom from Puniſhment rendring the Law of no weight with them.</p>
                  <p>But it is not ſo in the Laws of our Lord. They cannot be eſteem'd to loſe their efficacy for want of Puniſhment annexed. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commands, and ſhall teach Men ſo, ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> i. e. He ſhall have no place in it; ſhall be deſpiſed and rejected by God in the Day of Judgment. Even <hi>the Looking upon a Woman to luſt after her;</hi> and the being <hi>Angry with a Brother without a Cauſe,</hi> are eſteemed, by our Lawgiver, in the ſame rank with Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſhall be obnoxious to the ſame kind of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment with them. Which is well ſignified by the words in St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.22. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>He ſhall be liable to the Judgment, (viz.</hi> The Court of the Twenty Three Elders;) where the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Capital, though in a more mild manner than in the Council, (<hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi>) or in the <hi>Vally of Hinnom,</hi> denoted there, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49802:72"/> of <hi>Hell-fire.</hi> And therefore the leaſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment hereafter, being ſuch as anſwers to Death here, importeth no leſs than Death Eternal, though a leſſer degree thereof, than what ſhall be inflicted upon greater Sins.</p>

                  <p>But can this Motive be ſaid any way to prevail for our <hi>Love</hi> to theſe Laws? It may excite indeed a <hi>Dread,</hi> but not likely our <hi>Love.</hi>

                  <p>Yet, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> let things be ſeriouſly conſidered, and even from <hi>This Motive,</hi> how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoever it may, at firſt view, appear, there will be reaſon to <hi>love</hi> theſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>For, the Conſtituting ſuch Puniſhments is no more than what is meet to be done. Where the Laws are in themſelves ſo every way good, and where there are Eternal Rewards promiſed to the Obſervance of them; you will ſay, when they are diſobey'd, that it is but fit there ſhould be Penalties inflicted; and theſe Penalties ſuch as ſhall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Offences committed.</p>
                  <p>Now the greatneſs of the Offences is to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the exceeding Riches of Gods Bounty, <hi>viz.</hi> Everlaſting Rewards, held out unto Men, on Terms ſo excellent, and to Rational Natures ſo truly agreeable. If Theſe ſhall be deſpiſed, and caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs, the Sin is of a very great height; and what Puniſhment will ſo rightly ſute it, as the contrary to that Eternal Happineſs, which they have rejected, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal Miſery?</p>
                  <p>The meaſure of <hi>Gods Juſtice</hi> is to theſe Men not greater than the <hi>abundant Goodneſs</hi> was, which they ſo ungratefully refuſed. They ſhall not be thrown deeper in Hell, than by the Will of God they might have been raiſed in Heaven. Nor ſhall they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue longer in Puniſhments, than they ſhould have done in Joys.</p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:49802:73"/>
                  <p>Now theſe things, in Speculation, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to carry in them a <hi>dueneſs of proportion,</hi> and to be therefore <hi>bountiful;</hi> as indeed every thing in God and in his Actings, is; even his <hi>Juſtice</hi> no leſs than his <hi>Mercy.</hi> Only we are weak and ſinful, and ſo cannot over quickly diſcern it: But to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Conſideration it will at length ſhew itſelf ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>But that which comes more near us, and may more move our Love, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Intent</hi> of threatning theſe Puniſhments is <hi>primarily,</hi> not that they ſhould be <hi>born,</hi> but that they ſhould be <hi>eſcaped.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Self-preſervation is a thing ſo natural unto Men, that the fears of loſing their Welfare and Being, ſhall have a more quick touch upon them than any thing elſe. God therefore hath added this Motive of Fear, that it may be a ſpur to quicken us, when, by the Corruption of Nature, other Arguments are rendred leſs prevalent.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Puniſhments ſhall indeed be undergone by refractory Sinners; For they have, as much as in them lies, gone about to diſſolve utterly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity which is made up between God the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Men his People, by infringing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Divine Laws, and the Dignity of Him who is to ſee that they be obſerved. But it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſuch as Theſe, that theſe Puniſhments ſhall be undergone. To others they are chiefly a <hi>Motive</hi> to Obedience; and are further, only as a <hi>reſerve,</hi> when all other means have proved ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>The caſe in reſpect of Puniſhments is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent betwixt <hi>our</hi> Lawgiver, and Lawgivers <hi>on Earth.</hi> Some of <hi>Theſe</hi> are more forward to puniſh than to reward, becauſe Puniſhments do oftentimes increaſe their Treaſuries, and Rewards diminiſh them. But our Lord is no way profited by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49802:73"/> of any; neither in the rewarding them is his Abundance extenuated. Much <hi>delight</hi> he takes in the <hi>Life</hi> of Men; but he hath given us the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aſſurances, that he hath <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in the <hi>death</hi> of Sinners. His threatning therefore to puniſh them, is, that they may not be puniſhed. And truly, though we may dread the Effects of God's Juſtice, yet when he thereby ſhall awaken our Hearts that we may be the more <hi>ſecured unto Happineſs,</hi> as it may very much excite <hi>our Obedience,</hi> ſo may it alſo <hi>our Love</hi> to God's Law; even upon the account of threatning Eternal Puniſhments.</p>

                     <hi>Another Motive</hi> for the ſecuring of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws of Chriſt, is, their having <hi>ſtronger Aſſiſtances afforded for the Performance of them, than under the Old Law there were.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Holy Spirit will always joyn with our ſincere Endeavours, and will <hi>help our Infirmities.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Goſpel, and all the Laws of Jeſus Chriſt, are, in Holy Writ, called <hi>Spirit,</hi> by reaſon of the Grace of <hi>God's Spirit</hi> preventing, and enabling us in the doing of them, and are therein put in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, which is term'd <hi>the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Thus is it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>God hath fitted us to be Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit;</hi> i. e. not of the <hi>Old Law,</hi> but of the <hi>Evangelical;</hi> for the <hi>Letter killeth,</hi> but <hi>the Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Life; i. e.</hi> The Spirit with its Aſſiſtances in this Law enables us to perform it, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obtain Life. Hence it is that the Apoſtle (as ſome very Learned Perſons interpret him,) rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons more to the <hi>Conſtitution of a Chriſtian,</hi> than of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49802:74"/> 
                     <hi>other</hi> Men, joyning <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and giving <hi>that</hi> the precedence of the <hi>other two. I pray God your whole Spirit, Soul and Body, may be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 5.23.

                  <p>I hope, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> you do not think that the Aſſiſtances of the Holy Spirit are ſuch things as put by our Endeavours, and nouriſh our Sloth. They are Aſſiſtances, and ſo they do ſuppoſe that we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould do ſomthing. For were all to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49802:74"/> by the Holy Spirit, without the intervention of our Actions, we muſt call them by ſome other Name, for they could not properly be termed <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances.</hi> And therefore it is, that what our Lord doth <hi>accompliſh</hi> for us by his <hi>Grace</hi> through the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, he <hi>enjoyneth</hi> us by his <hi>Command</hi> to do, as of our <hi>own Power. He worketh in us to will and to do;</hi> but <hi>yet we are to work out our own Salvation.</hi> He <hi>ſtrengtheneth us,</hi> but <hi>we</hi> are to <hi>ſtrive;</hi> The <hi>Victory</hi> is from <hi>Him,</hi> but the <hi>Fighting</hi> muſt be <hi>ours.</hi> And ſo, it is very true what you ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Work ſeems not to be the <hi>leſs</hi> to us for the Aſſiſtances which he gives; we muſt be altogether as induſtrious, and earneſt, as if the whole were to be done by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and nothing at all by Him.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe, when we have done all which we are able to do, we can ſee much of Human Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Actions, and but little of Divine Strength, ſhall we therefore conclude that the Aſſiſtances of the Spirit have been none, or, at moſt, very mean, and nothing worthy of the Character which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them? What, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> if the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in his aiding us, will ſo comply with the Natural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our Souls, that we cannot diſcetn <hi>his</hi> Actings from our own? What if he, in a ſilent and gentle manner, ſhall ſuggeſt things to our Underſtandings, ſhall ſecretly ſway our Wills, and move our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons really, but yet imperceivably unto us? Let us not, becauſe he <hi>draws us with the Cords of a Man,</hi> ſay that we are not drawn at all. If, when we have done our beſt we ſeem to ourſelves to be weak, and to have done far leſs than we ſhould have done, it poſſibly is none of the leaſt Aids of the Spirit, that we can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our own weakneſs, and deſire to pleaſe God, even beyond our Abilities. <hi>His Grace can</hi> be, and it this way <hi>is,</hi> very properly, <hi>made perfect in our Weakneſs.</hi> I dare be bold to ſay, that he is not prompted from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49802:75"/> above, who ſhall deny that there are Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, becauſe there is not a Demonſtration to the Soul that there are ſuch. Nay, it may ſeem expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that ordinarily they ſhould be ſecret and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible: For, ſhould they commonly be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Men would be too apt to <hi>rely upon</hi> them; and thereby <hi>do leſs</hi> themſelves, becauſe they ſee what their <hi>Aids</hi> are. Or, it may be, they would <hi>grow conceited</hi> and abuſe the helps of Gods Holy Spirit to the overthrow of the Excellent Grace of Humility. Out of Mercy therefore the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> may In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly give his Aids unto Men; that ſo, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in their endeavours, they at laſt may attain unto a greater perfection of all Graces, and may the ſurer enjoy his Love by their Humility.</p>

                  <p>There would be certainty enough of it from the Scriptures Revealing that ſuch Aſſiſtances there are, although we ſhould not know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them; nor the times in which they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.</p>
                  <p>But yet, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> theſe Spiritual Aids are not always indiſcernible neither. They oftentimes are ſeen by their effects, though in their actings they were unperceiv'd. And when a Mans Life is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he, that heretofore was Diſſolute and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is now become Sober and Religious; Or, when, in a conſtant courſe of Piety and Devotion, he, from his Childhood hath eſcaped the <hi>enticements of Satan,</hi> and <hi>pollutions of the World,</hi> we (and he himſelf alſo,) though thoſe Aſſiſtances have not been diſcerned, may no leſs know, that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49802:75"/> with him, than we know that there is <hi>a Wind</hi> when we <hi>hear the Sound thereof,</hi> though we <hi>ſee not whence it cometh nor whither it goeth.</hi> And yet further, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> after faithful Obedience to the more Silent and Gentle Motions of the Holy Spirit, it is not altogether unuſual to have inward and ſacred Joys darted into the Soul; which, as they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for Fidelity in the years paſt, ſo are they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe more ſenſible Helps for higher degrees of Piety in the years to come; and prelibations of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Joy which Holy Men ſhall be filled with hereafter in Heaven. If there be not ſuch diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſiſtances more frequent in the World, it is, either becauſe Men do not duly cloſe with the Holy Spirit in his Ordinary and Secret Aids; or becauſe they indulge a Sad and Melancholy Temper, which ſhuts them out of the Soul; or, becauſe God ſees them not requiſite for a great many Perſons. But yet the Laws of our Lord may notwithſtanding be truly ſaid to have more ſtrong Aſſiſtances afforded, than under the Old Law there were; and deſervedly to be entitled ſo much to <hi>the Spirit,</hi> from the Secret Helps which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> offers unto all that are willing to obey.</p>

                  <p>I was willing to urge you ſomthing the more upon this Head, becauſe the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Honour of the Evangelical Laws; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many are forward to talk ſlightly of his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, upon the account that they are not Viſible to the Eye, nor groſs enough to be touch'd.</p>

                  <p>I heartily pity the State of theſe Men, ſince none are more ſurely in the way to Miſery, than thoſe that laugh at the Aids to Happineſs; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when held out by a Divine Hand.</p>
                  <p>But let us go to the <hi>Third and laſt Motive</hi> for the ſecuring of Obedience to theſe Laws; which is,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49802:76"/> their <hi>having ſuch Loving Invitations and Affectionate Expreſſions of Kindneſs joyn'd with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Come unto me</hi> (ſaith our Lord,) <hi>all ye that Labour and are heavy Laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Where, by thoſe that <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>are heavy Laden,</hi> I ſuppoſe, that They are not only to be underſtood, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the burden of their Sins, and ſee the neceſſity of Grace from their Miſdoings. Our Lord here calls Men not only to Comfort but alſo to Teach and Inſtruct them; that they may come to an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their Sins; which in their own Nature are a Weight and Burden; although they be not yet perceived ſo to be. After the manner of thoſe who, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17 <hi>were Wretched and Miſerable, and Poor and Blind and Naked;</hi> when they felt no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>So that all Men here are called by Chriſt; whether they be ſuch as think themſelves to be miſerable, or ſuch as do not. That by the One the Miſery which they, in good ſort, perceive, may be avoided; and from the Other, the Miſery which they are under, though they ſee it not, may by good Inſtructions be removed; and they brought into thoſe Paths which will give them a true reſt from Sin at the preſent; and will bring them into Everlaſting Reſt hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And how perſuaſive is that of St. <hi>Paul? We as Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be you reconciled unto God, i. e.</hi> be you Obedient to his Laws, and thereby reconcile yourſelves unto him, who by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience were his Enemies. And how ſtrangely may this prevail for Love to God's Law, when his Commands, of themſelves Righteous and Gentle, are yet further ſoftned by kind Invitations and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Beſeechings!</p>
                  <p>Theſe are, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the <hi>general Motives</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to all the Divine Laws together, and if we will
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49802:76"/> not be obſtinate, nor lay aſide our Underſtandings, with what pleaſing Strengths will they come upon our Souls, and ſway them into Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!</p>

                  <p>But methinks, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> there is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſome things in them, which were a great Ornament to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and, as it may ſeem, would be no leſs ſo to That of our Lord: <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Viſible Expreſſions (which I remember you mention'd in your firſt Walk,) of God's <hi>Power and Preſence,</hi> in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> in <hi>Oracles from the Ark;</hi> in the <hi>wondrous Activeneſs</hi> of the <hi>ſacred Fire;</hi> in the <hi>Cloud filling the Temple;</hi> and alſo in <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Deliverances and Revenges.</hi> Theſe, you ſaid, kept the love of Gods Laws awake, that it ſunk not into Careleſneſs and Irreverence. Is there not as <hi>much need</hi> of theſe things, or ſuch as theſe, now? And would they not have been meet to accompany the Evangelical Motives you inſtanced in?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe were things which were adapted for that State, where Men were to be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on chiefly by means that could be ſeen and felt, and were, as yet, not ſo fit for a more ſpiritual Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But now, when Heavenly Myſteries and Rewards are ſo fully revealed, it would be our ſhame, if, not ſatisfied with them, we ſhould ſtill be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after outward and ſenſible Manifeſtations. And I ſpeak a truth when I ſay, That God's being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us in a ſpiritual manner, is more ſuitable to his Nature, which is incorporeal, than his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in a Cloud, or by other viſible or audible Ways, in the Jewiſh Temple, was. And it is alſo a more perfect Way than was that other. <hi>That</hi> being more to the outward ſenſe, and the weaker part of Man; <hi>This</hi> more to the Soul, which is his Excellence: <hi>That</hi> being exerciſed through viſible things; <hi>This</hi> through the Holy Spirit who is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49802:77"/> and infinitely ſurpaſſeth them. Neither is there wanting what may keep our Love from Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs, as much, or more, than what under the Old Law there did: <hi>The Word of God is ſharper than a two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of the Joynts and Marrow;</hi> and the Holy Spirit, like <hi>a Refiner's Fire,</hi> will give a quickneſs unto, and keep up vigour in, our Love.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> there ſhould be viſible and continued Manifeſtations of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as of old there were: In tract of time they would be eſteem'd little different from the effects of Nature; and would prevail with Men no more than the Courſe of the Sun and Moon, and the Growth of Trees and Herbs; which, from their commonneſs, make ſmall Impreſſions upon the leſs knowing, and immoral ſort of Men. And, it may be, theſe more open Expreſſions of his Power and Preſence, which God Almighty gave under the firſt Temple, he therefore denied under the ſecond, becauſe their every-days being ſeen, made them ſo little taken notice of, that they thereby, in great meaſure, loſt their End.</p>
                  <p>But if you would have the Divine Power to be, now and then, in extraordinary Concerns, exerted beyond the common road of Nature, (as I cannot ſay, but ſomtimes it now is, though very rarely,) neither would this poſſibly have the effect you think of. We live in a curious and uncrediting World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe, whom theſe things ſhould moſt work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would, if far diſtant, not believe that there were ſuch things: If they ſhould be ſo near as to ſee them, they would be forward to ſolve ſuch Acts by Natural Reaſons, and thereby render them fruitleſs to themſelves. However it be, we in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may ſay, That God in theſe later Ages of the World, chuſeth to manifeſt himſelf more by the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49802:77"/> exerciſe of his Wiſdom, than by the open Effects of his Power; herein dealing with Men according to their own way, Policy and Contrivance being that which almoſt every one affecteth. And from the more quiet and wiſe diſpoſal of things now, God's Hand, by religious and conſidering Men, may as truly be acknowledged, as when his Methods were more diſcernable by the Eye.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, ſince the Divine Laws, as now they are ſettled, are abundantly fitted for the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſober and docible Minds; and thoſe viſible effects of God's Power would not, in all likelihood, ſway with thoſe who are of a contrary Diſpoſition; and his ſecret way of acting is the choice of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to confound and bring under the evil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of Men, in a ſuitable and agreeing manner, we have no reaſon to complain, as if there were a want of thoſe viſible Expreſſions of his Power and Preſence which he heretofore afforded; and we are very unjuſt, if we prefer ſome Motives belonging to the Law of old, before thoſe which appertain to the Divine Law now.</p>

                  <p>What ſtronger Motives can there be for <hi>Peoples Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Love to their Miniſters,</hi> than that they are <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God,</hi> upon their account?

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither are the Duties of <hi>Paſtors</hi> urged with leſs Weight.

                  <p>For <hi>Mutual Love</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> between Thoſe <hi>whom Wedlock hath joyn'd,</hi> it is an highly ſacred Motive, That Marriage is ſo far honour'd as to become <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious,</hi> in the Signification of <hi>Chriſt the Bridegroom, and the Church his Spouſe;</hi> and of <hi>that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which is between them, <hi>never to be diſſolved.</hi> And how admirably may the <hi>Hardneſs of Mens Hearts</hi> be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by ſuch a Conſideration as this! And, how is the <hi>Credit</hi> of thoſe who are the <hi>Weaker Sex</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, by not being permitted now to be caſt off upon every trivial Diſtaſte! For that Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Signification, which we ſaid Marriage is enobled with, doth plainly hint that the Bond thereof is to continue firm and unbroken; and that the <hi>Faithful Affections</hi> both of the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> in the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pair, will certainly, with other Virtues, after this Life, be rewarded; living, in a manner, for ever in that <hi>Divine Love</hi> they did here <hi>repreſent.</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>Childrens Obedience</hi> is quickned, by <hi>its being in the Lord:</hi> Which Expreſſion doth not only hint the <hi>Extent</hi> of their Obedience, and how far it ſhould reach, but doth ſhew alſo that <hi>God is concern'd in it,</hi> and doth obſerve whether it be truly perform'd or no. And the taking notice of the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as <hi>being the firſt that hath a Promiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd unto it;</hi> and the improving that Promiſe of <hi>Earthly and Temporal Bleſſings</hi> into <hi>Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> is a very high Encouragement of the Duty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Faithfulneſs of Servants</hi> hath Motives admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſtrong; to wit, <hi>That they do Service to Chriſt, while they do it conſcionably to their Maſters.</hi> That He ſees their Diligence or Loitering, when their Maſters cannot: And that <hi>He</hi> will <hi>reward</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                  <p>And <hi>Maſters</hi> have a Motive equally as ſtrong for their <hi>Gentleneſs and Goodneſs</hi> towards their Servants, from their <hi>having a Maſter in Heaven, with whom is no reſpect of Perſons.</hi> Which imports that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which a Maſter hath on Earth, ſhall not in Heaven, or at God's Bar, ſtand him in any ſtead, if he bear it hardly and frowardly towards his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>

Shall ſuch or ſuch an Offence make me an Enemy to <hi>him for whom Chriſt hath died?</hi> Shall any Worldly Concern overturn that Love, and break that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> which Chriſt hath <hi>Cemented,</hi> and Eſtabliſhed with <hi>his own moſt precious Blood?</hi> A mighty Inducement for the love of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>this:</hi> Though not proper to this Relation alone, but running through all the foregoing ones.

                  <p>For the keeping of our Bodies free from <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> can there be any thing more prevailing than that they <hi>are Members of that Body, to which Chriſt is the Head?</hi> That they are <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt? That they are bought with a price,</hi> even with <hi>the Blood of Chriſt?</hi> And that they will not be <hi>loſt</hi> when they are laid in the Earth; but will be raiſed <hi>up again from the Dead?</hi> And he who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to weigh theſe things rightly, How can he take the <hi>Members of Chriſt</hi> and make them the <hi>Inſtruments of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> the <hi>Receptacles of Luxury</hi> and <hi>Exceſs?</hi> How can he pollute that <hi>Temple</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt doth <hi>Conſecrate,</hi> and delight to reſide in?

                  <p>Another Law, reſpecting ourſelves, <hi>is the keeping our Hearts pure.</hi> And what Motive hereunto can be wiſh'd for greater than the <hi>ſeeing of God; i. e.</hi> the being fitted thereby for that Viſion of him which is Beatifick; nothing that is impure being to enter there, where God's moſt Glorious Preſence is? And not only ſo ſhall they <hi>ſee God,</hi> but he will manifeſt Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo unto them by the <hi>Joys</hi> of his <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> within them; and by the <hi>opening of their Eyes,</hi> that they <hi>may behold the wondrous things of his Law;</hi> yea, and ſee him in every thing.</p>
                  <p>A Third Law to a Man's ſelf, is the <hi>Cutting off the Right Hand, and pulling out the Right Eye,</hi> in <hi>caſe they offend him; i. e.</hi> the being willing to part with any thing, how uſeful and pleaſant ſoever it be, rather than to be enſnared by it, or betray'd into Sin. And who will be un-willing to do this when he hears, <hi>that it is better for him to enter into Life Blind or Maimed, than having two Hands or two Eyes to be caſt into Everlaſting Fire?</hi> Not as if Lameneſs or the having One Eye ſhould continue with him after his Entrance into Life. No, God can ſupply all thoſe defects, and he will do it. But if any outward thing which poſſibly may not be leſs dear to the Man, than his Hand or Eye, ſhall occaſionally enſnare him, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing corrupt deſires; which cannot well be avoided otherwiſe than by parting with theſe Enjoyments: Better it will be to go to Heaven without them, where Eternal Happineſs ſhall make up ſuch loſſes,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49802:80"/> than retaining them in this World to be thrown into Hell, where he ſhall be for ever loſt to them, and to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>laſt Law</hi> (or Laws rather,) reſpecting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is <hi>the putting away all Carking, Carefulneſs, Diſcontent</hi> and <hi>Impatience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to conceive a more winning Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt Carefulneſs, than that which the words of our Bleſſed Lord afford us. <hi>Take no thought for your Life, what ye ſhall Eat, or what ye ſhall Drink; nor yet for your Body, what ye ſhall put on. Is not Life more than Meat, and the Body than Rayment? Behold the Fowls of the Air; for they Sow not, neither do they Reap, nor gather into Barns; yet your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father feedeth them.</hi> And <hi>why take ye thought for Rayment? Conſider the Lillies of the Field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they Spin; yet I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his Glory was not arrayed like one of theſe. If God then ſo cloath the Graſs of the Field, which to Day is, and to Morrow is caſt into the Oven, ſhall he not much more Cloath you, O ye of little Faith?</hi> Truly ſo pleaſing and powerful are theſe perſuaſives, that they may allay all anxious Cares, no leſs from their Speculation, than from the Enjoyment of the things they ſpeak of. And with ſuch a Sacred Artfulneſs doth our Lord urge them, that they not only, <hi>for their matter,</hi> excel all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of the Antients; but, <hi>for their expreſſion,</hi> all their Oratory alſo.</p>
                  <p>And what may more nouriſh <hi>Contentation of Life,</hi> than, <hi>That in God we Live, and Move, and have our Being.</hi> That he is infinitely Wiſe, and ſo knows what is beſt for us; infinitely good, and ſo is not wanting to his Creatures? That, we are <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims here;</hi> and ſo 'tis reaſonable, that <hi>having Food and Raiment, we ſhould therewith be content?</hi> That he hath given us the greateſt Bleſſing of his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49802:81"/> Love, his only Son to dye for us; and ſo we may well be content if ſome leſſer Bleſſing be denied us; which yet if we enjoy'd, we could not tell whether they would be Bleſſings to us or not?</p>
                  <p>And are the <hi>Motives for Patience in Troubles,</hi> leſs ſtrong and prevailing? Certainly they are not. This Grace hath a <hi>Mark of Honour</hi> affixed upon it, greater than which there cannot be. For God is ſtyled the <hi>God of Patience;</hi> and we have his Faithfulneſs as a Pledge, that amidſt our ſufferings we ſhall not be forſaken. <hi>God is Faithful, who will not permit you to be Tempted above that which you are able: But will, with the Temptation, make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> At ſuch gracious expreſſions, who is it will not be Patient? Nay, when we, as our Saviour was, are to be made <hi>perfect by Sufferings;</hi> when, through his eſpecial favour, <hi>they work for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> what Man is it, that, in his conſiderate thoughts, will not acknowledge, he hath reaſon even to <hi>rejoyce in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Motives for Patience are ſuch as are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuitable to the Soul in its moſt perfect Actings and Deſires; and are fitted to obtain their end, not on <hi>ſome Tempers</hi> only, which are of the more ſturdy, and leſs ſenſible ſort; but on <hi>all Men</hi> who have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding to conſider things aright. They require not that we ſhould think that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the things that are out of our power,</hi> have no Relation unto us; That there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Pain</hi> in the World; or if there be, that it is not <hi>Evil.</hi> No, we are look'd upon as <hi>Men;</hi> and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to have a ſenſe of the Afflictions that lie upon us: And, even while it is <hi>thus</hi> with us, we have Supports and Comforts, not ſuch as are only <hi>verba &amp; voces, airy</hi> and <hi>thin, deceiving</hi> us for a while into quietneſs; but <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> ones, ſinking
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49802:81"/> into the Vitals, and in reality, greater than all the Troubles we can undergo.</p>

                  <p>I have known ſome, who, poſſibly, from ſuch Conſiderations, have born up even under very great Afflictions. But yet when God hath deprived them of ſome <hi>near Friends;</hi> or of <hi>One</hi> whom the <hi>Paſſion of Love</hi> hath more intimately united to them than the <hi>cloſeſt Ties from Blood</hi> could do, have loſt all their Patience. As <hi>Rachel wept for her Children and would not be comforted becauſe they were not;</hi> ſo is it with theſe; and ſomtimes their Sorrow ſo much prevails, as to bring them <hi>down even into the Grave</hi> for their Deceaſed Friends.</p>

                  <p>What you ſay is true; though I could wiſh it were not, for the Sake of more than one who are equally Dear to you and me. But I am not ſorry that you have mention'd it; becauſe, there are ſuch proper and excellent Motives afforded by our Lord, for the Alleviating our Grief at the Death of Friends.</p>
                  <p>When they <hi>Dye,</hi> we are told they are <hi>but aſleep,</hi> and will after a while awake again: And therefore <hi>we are not to Sorrow as ſome others do, who have no hope.</hi> While we commit them to the Ground, they are in a manner <hi>Sown,</hi> as our <hi>Corn is,</hi> and will come up again to greater advantage, both to us and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>They are Sown in Corruption, they ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Incorruption;</hi> they <hi>are Sown in Diſhonour, they ſhall be raiſed in Glory. They are Sown in Weakneſs, they ſhall be raiſed in Power; they are Sown Natural Bodies, they ſhall be raiſed Spiritual.</hi> This is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, and not only ſo, but is confirmed by our <hi>Lords own Riſing from the Dead,</hi> and becoming the <hi>Firſt-Fruits of them that Slept.</hi> Which implies, that as the Harveſt followeth the Firſt-Fruits, ſo ſhall our Chriſtian Friends, with all other Holy Men, follow our Lord in his Reſurrection. It is very remarkable
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49802:82"/> that the Holy Scripture gives to the <hi>whole Church,</hi> as united with its Head, <hi>The Name of Chriſt.</hi> Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>As the Body is one, and hath many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all the Members of that one Body being many, are one Body, SO ALSO IS CHRIST.</hi> Whence there may ſeem an holy Neceſſity that our Religious Friends ſhould riſe from the Dead. They are parts of the Church; and as the Church and Chriſt <hi>are one, He</hi> could not be ſaid to be <hi>wholly riſen,</hi> unleſs <hi>They</hi> likewiſe ſhould riſe from the Dead. <hi>If there be no Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>then is Chriſt not riſen;</hi> which is true alſo in this ſenſe. His Reſurrection would be incompleat, and in effect no Reſurrection, ſhould not his <hi>Church,</hi> which is his Body, riſe after him. What need is there then of ſo many Lamentations, and of ſuch Floods of Tears? Why ſhould we be dejected at the Graves of our Friends? which we may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the places from which they will ariſe, rather than as the places wherein they are buried?</p>
                  <p>And what may yet further contribute to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing of our Sorrow, is their riſing again <hi>never to be ſick more; Never any more to leave us;</hi> but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy us, and to be enjoyed by us, in an Eternity of Happineſs. For it cannot reaſonably be thought, that thoſe <hi>particular Friendſhips,</hi> which were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Virtue, will not hereafter be continued in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; eſpecially ſince a <hi>Religious Faithfulneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Affection</hi> ſhall have a good ſhare in the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Rewards which are there given. So that we ſhall have our Friends again, and much more ours, than ever they were before.</p>
                  <p>Neither even at the preſent is our <hi>Communion</hi> with them diſſolved by their Death: For that Bond which unites us one to another, and to our Head, is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; and ſo Death, which only divides the Soul from the Body, makes no real ſeparation of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49802:82"/> Chriſtian who is dead, from the Chriſtians who are alive. For they who ſtill <hi>continue Members</hi> of the <hi>ſame Head,</hi> do alſo <hi>continue Members one of another.</hi> And the ſame good Will which our Friends, as Chriſtians, had to us while they lived, we may ſafely believe they have after they have left us: Such as conſiſteth in the <hi>making Supplications</hi> unto God, that it may be well with us both in Life and Death; and in <hi>rejoycing</hi> at thoſe Spiritual Bleſſings which are held out unto us for the obtaining that Happineſs which they, before us, have reach'd unto.</p>
                  <p>Why then ſhould we grieve as though they were quite loſt unto us? As though all our Intereſt in them were buried in their Graves; and all that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Kindneſs they bore us, were wholly extinct? We rather may rejoyce that their Love towards us, and other Chriſtians, is increaſed, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as their own Happineſs is increaſed, and themſelves are more perfect.</p>

                  <p>What you ſay, might adminiſter unto Patience, were it not that the <hi>Fears of an Hell,</hi> and the Apprehenſions that it may be worſe with them now they are dead, than it was when they were alive, did not ſo often interpoſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>But why ſhould we ſuffer ſuch Fears and Apprehenſions to interpoſe in relation to thoſe Friends who have loved Religion and Virtue, and made them viſible in their Lives? Precious in the ſight of God is the death of ſuch. And as for thoſe daily Slips and Failures, which proceed only from that Weakneſs which is common to all Mankind, they, from the Sincerity which hath been in the Heart, ſhall be forgiven. Indeed there are ſome Perſons for whom our Hopes cannot be ſo great; and we are not to be blamed if our Griefs be of a larger meaſure in the Deaths of theſe. But yet we are by no means to paſs ſentence ourſelves upon
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49802:83"/> them, but muſt leave them to ſtand or fall to their own Maſter. And the <hi>ſame God</hi> that commands us to be <hi>charitable,</hi> means that we ſhould be ſo, not only to the <hi>Living,</hi> but the <hi>Dead</hi> alſo: And if he ſo ſtrictly enjoyns <hi>our Charity</hi> towards them, we have ſome reaſon to hope, he will not deny unto them <hi>his own Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is certain, that however the evil Lives of ſome Men may render the Thoughts of Death leſs comfortable to themſelves and others, yet, through our dear Lord's Dying for us, Death is, in reality, become an harmleſs thing to us, as we are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and we may Triumphantly uſe the words of St. <hi>Paul; O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? Thanks be unto God who hath given us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nay, though Death to our Bodily Eyes hath Terrour in its Face, and is attended with Worms and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet the ſame Apoſtle reckons it a part of <hi>the Church's Dowry,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22. <hi>Whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or Life, or DEATH, or Things preſent, or Things to come, all are yours;</hi> and the ſame we may eſteem it to be in relation to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Friends.</p>
                  <p>You have ſeen, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the excellent Motives for Patience on every Hand; and for Obedience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the other Laws that more nearly concern our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And truly the conceiving of a Man whoſe outward actions are all Clean and Chaſt; whoſe inward Thoughts are Pure and Holy; who can part with even Lawful Enjoyments rather than be inſnared by them; who is contented with his Lot; not anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the years to come, and cheerfully bearing up under preſent ſufferings; the conceiving, I ſay, of ſuch an one, ſo every way perfect, is very pleaſant to the thoughts; and we cannot ſooner think of him
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49802:83"/> than we muſt Love him; the Laws then that form the Man to be ſuch, muſt needs be no leſs fitted for our Love and Delight; and theſe, ſure, will much be heightned from ſuch pleaſing and weighty Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

That I would not part with one Leaf of theſe Holy Laws, might I have the whole World in Exchange.</hi> They are able to make (would Men permit them,) an Heaven upon Earth; while Peace and Joy and Love would be in the Community, and an Holy Calmneſs and Inexpreſſible Pleaſure, in every private Breaſt.</p>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>Truly, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> it is impoſſible there ſhould be any true Happineſs without them. Should not the Underſtanding be recovered from that Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Errour which are in it; ſhould not the Will be reduced from its Pravity and Perverſeneſs: Should not the Affections be delivered from their Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs and Evil Exceſſes, even Heaven would not be a place of Joy and Bliſs. For how una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable would Glorious Manſions be, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Body, were the Soul imperfect and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all its Faculties; unacquainted with Holineſs, ſecretly grudging at God's Will, and openly diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying it? What would the Salvation be, ſhould Saint with Saint carry it ill-naturedly; and enjoy their Immortality, only for the Perpetuating of their Diſſentions?</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:49802:84"/>
                  <p>And if to them, whoſe Natures are not faſhioned by theſe Laws, <hi>Heaven</hi> would not afford an Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we may be ſure, <hi>Earth</hi> will not. Which makes me, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> to pity thoſe Men as Enemies to their own Welfare, who eſteem Liberty and Greatneſs to be then alone truly perfect, when they are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Licentiouſneſs; doing whatever liketh them, without any reſpect had to the Laws of God or Man. Whereas God himſelf, who is infinite in Majeſty, and moſt abſolute in Power, acteth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Eternal Laws of Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs: And it is the perfection of his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Liberty, ſo to do.</p>

                  <p>What you have ſaid I cannot gainſay, but do much approve. And though, I confeſs, I could never think, (as ſome have done,) that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bare ſaying that they are the Word of God, is a ſufficient Teſtimony that they are ſo;</hi> yet from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Excellence of theſe Laws, and thoſe admirable Motives which are added to them for the ſecuring of our Obedience, there is, methinks, a ſubſtantial Proof of their Divinity and Truth.</p>
                  <p>Can it be thought that the <hi>Devil could</hi> ever prompt any Man to make Laws ſo righteous and good as theſe are? Or <hi>that he would</hi> promote their Obſervance with ſuch mighty Rewards, ſuch ſevere Threatnings, and ſuch ſacred Conſiderations? If ſo, then ſurely our Saviour's Argument of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans being divided againſt himſelf,</hi> and his Kingdoms not being able thereby to ſtand, might be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as valid in the preſent caſe, as then it was, when the Jews ſaid, that <hi>Devils were caſt out by</hi> Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub <hi>the Prince of the Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither have we more reaſon to imagine, That <hi>any Man</hi> out of his own <hi>falſeneſs</hi> and <hi>deceit</hi> did make theſe Laws, ſince they are ſo directly deſtructive of all <hi>falſeneſs</hi> and <hi>deceit;</hi> and may juſtly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49802:84"/> to be everlaſtingly ſo, in that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the World with Conſiderations ſo powerful and ſavoury.</p>
                  <p>From their own Purity, therefore, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they may well be own'd to be the ſame Divine Precepts, which in reality they are.</p>

                  <p>And let me add, That <hi>no Man</hi> ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be ſo much honour'd among Men, as <hi>He</hi> hath done, who hath given theſe Laws, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all example, hath encouraged their practice.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but think ſomtimes, how highly the grave <hi>Lucretius</hi> hath extoll'd (and is himſelf highly extoll'd by ſome for ſo doing,) his <hi>Epicurus;</hi> who endeavour'd to Arm Men againſt all Fears, by the beating down of all Religion, and the excluding the Gods from the knowledge of every thing on Earth, as being <hi>neither pleas'd with good Actions, nor offended with evil ones.</hi> And He (ſo far well,) doth ſhew, that all other Inventions, however very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the Welfare of Men, are yet nothing to be compared to <hi>That</hi> which will quiet tumultuous Paſſions, and render the Mind well informed and ſteady. Compare, ſaith he, <hi>with This,</hi> the great things which others have found out: <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> are much honour'd; <hi>She,</hi> as having firſt taught the way of ſowing Corn; <hi>He,</hi> as having firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed Men in planting of Vines: But yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe things Mens Lives may be ſuſtain'd; and, as report goes, ſome Nations, even now, do live without them. <hi>At bene non poterat ſine puro pectore vivi;</hi> but without a Breaſt well purged, a Man can have no happy Life. And then he goes on with the Praiſes of his Philoſopher, as being worthy a Place among the Gods.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>He</hi> had ſo much Honour, who profanely taught Men not to fear, what ſhall our Lord have, who, with ſacred Religion, directs Men in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49802:85"/> and right Paths to Happineſs? Who gives them Laws, which will render them eaſie to themſelves, and acceptable unto others; Who, in any Troubles that may befal them, affords them the only Methods of Comfort; by telling them, that God is a Father unto Men; in every thing taking care of them, and ordering even Afflictions for the good of thoſe who are pious; Who makes known everlaſting Joys af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, which are prepared for thoſe that live holy Lives; and renders the way thereunto not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult by the help which he continually vouchſafes from above; And all this in ſuch a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by having loved us even unto Death, with a Love much ſtronger than Death itſelf.</p>

                  <p>Our Lord doth indeed, in theſe things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Honour above all Men; and we may often, on his account, ſing that Anthem which, at his Birth, the Angels ſung, <hi>Glory be to God on high; on Earth, Peace; Good-will towards Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I will further ſay, That They, who faithfully give up their Names unto him, have the Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not only of all Thoſe, who, among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, pretended to the ſtudy of Wiſdom, but alſo of God's own People the Jews; yea, in a ſort, even of <hi>David</hi> himſelf, who was ſo dear to him; and whom, in our Diſcourſe, we have had occaſion ſo often to mention.</p>
                  <p>For though I cannot but yield, that this King had a fair inſight into the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the things belonging unto it, (there being in his <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſo many undoubted Deſcriptions thereof,) yet it will not be an Untruth to affirm, That the meaneſt Chriſtian among us hath (unleſs it be his own fault,) more clear Revelations of Chriſt, of Life and Immortality, and of the Aſſiſtances of the Holy Spirit, than <hi>David</hi> had, or any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>

                  <p>But, pray, <hi>Eubulus, Since the Law is ſo good, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances ſo great, and Motives ſo taking, how comes it to paſs, that there ſhould be ſo many diſobedient ones, as we, almoſt every where, ſee there are?</hi>

                  <p>It is a truth what you ſay; though a ſad one to be told. Yet while there is ſo much Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pravity in the Heart of Men, and ſo many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations abroad, it is not difficult to gueſs the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>For Chriſtian Religion, though it often-times overcomes our Natural Corruptions, yet doth not wholly root them out; and evil Inclinations will ſway a great many from their Duty.</p>
                  <p>The Rewards, which our Lawgiver promiſeth, are chiefly future and ſpiritual; and Men (ſuch is their Earthlineſs,) are generally for thoſe things that are preſent, and can be ſeen: And when thoſe ſhall ſtrongly ſolicit, and make ſhews of great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, or Pleaſures, or Honours, it is no wonder that Multitudes are led away by them.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, That the Proofs of Chriſtianity are not ſuch as will compel Mens aſſent unto them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no, but are to be inculcated often upon their Hearts, that they may there be firmly rooted. Now this requires Pains and Induſtry; and if many Men are for Sloth and Eaſe, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the weighing and conſidering of things to be harder, and more tedious, than bodily Labour, we may quickly diſcern wherefore it is, that the Laws of our Lord are ſo little obſerved.</p>
                  <p>And truly, the Actings of the Holy Ghoſt with Men, which are not ordinarily according to the fulneſs of his Power, but ſo as may be reſiſted, are, in the preſent caſe, worthy our Conſideration. He by his Motions within us doth perſuade, and ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he propoſeth our Welfare, ſuggeſting the true means of obtaining it, and furniſhing us with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49802:86"/> Strength and Aids from above, if we will admit of, and cloſe with, them; but he doth not uſually, with an <hi>irreſiſtible Power,</hi> conſtrain us. And hence are thoſe Expreſſions in Holy Writ, of <hi>quenching</hi> and <hi>reſiſting</hi> the Spirit; which, if he acted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatneſs and extent of his Might, could not be quenched nor reſiſted.</p>
                  <p>Now, when Men are left to chuſe what Paths they will take; when they muſt come in (as it were,) <hi>to the help of the Lord</hi> againſt their own Corruptions, and thoſe Pleaſures of Senſe, which (as the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Apple did,) <hi>look fair,</hi> and <hi>to be deſired,</hi> it may not ſeem ſtrange, that theſe are choſen, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Precepts neglected.</p>
                  <p>Neither is Chriſtian Religion to be faulted, as if it did not provide means ſufficient for the retaining Men in Obedience. It provides ſo far as is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with their Virtue, which brooks not Force, and would be loſt, had it not the Will along with it.</p>
                  <p>And from what hath been ſaid, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> you may gueſs how it comes to paſs, that though the Laws are ſo good, Aſſiſtances ſo great, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſo taking, there yet are ſo many that continue in Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt not make our Walk to be the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Health. It is a moiſt Air, and yonder Clouds look black upon us: An happy Night there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to my <hi>Theophilus.</hi>

                  <p>THE laſt part, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> of your Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Diſcourſe, occaſion'd a more than ordinary thoughtfulneſs in me. <hi>The Lives of Chriſtians</hi> I reflected upon; and they, almoſt every where, appeared unto me little leſs than a contradiction to the Laws of Chriſt. Where is not <hi>Piety</hi> towards God neglected? <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> towards Men, not carried on? <hi>Enmity</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> not nouriſh'd? <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>

In the midſt of theſe my Thoughts, I was ſtruck with thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>It had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than, after they have known it, to turn from the Holy Commandment deliver'd unto them.</hi> And the <hi>not walking according to the Laws of the Goſpel,</hi> however the Name of Chriſt be openly profeſs'd, I look upon to be a <hi>Turning from the Holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And though I ſtill acknowledg'd (and for ever ſhall acknowledge,) the Divine Laws to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Good, and the Bleſſing promiſed to them to be the higheſt expreſſion of God's Love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet at laſt, I fell to think, <hi>whether the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49802:88"/> of the Generality of Men, had not brought it to that paſs, that conſidering the greater Torments they ſhall hereafter ſuffer by occaſion of theſe Laws being given, and the Goſpel's being Reveal'd, it would not have been better, that theſe Laws ſhould not have been given, and the Goſpel not have heen Reveal'd unto Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not juſtifie my Thought, as if it were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; it ſeemed to me, and ſtill ſeems, Irregular. But, for the time, it was ſo lodg'd within me, that I could not eaſily remove it.</p>

                  <p>NEither will I commend <hi>this your Thought.</hi> But leſt it ſhould leave behind it ſome Scruples in you, I think theſe things may, with Innocence, be replyed unto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> That though there are many that refuſe the great Love of our Lord in his Laws, and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs promiſed in the Goſpel; yet ſome there are who do entertain and embrace them and who always ſhall do ſo.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Elijah</hi> thought that <hi>He,</hi> even <hi>He alone was left a true Worſhipper of the God of Iſrael,</hi> there were <hi>Seven Thouſand in Iſrael who had not bow'd their Knee to Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 19.18. Our Lawgiver hath, and for ever will have, a flock of Obedient ones; though a <hi>little flock it be.</hi> And better it is, ſure, that ſome through the Goſpel ſhould be Saved, than that all without it ſhould Periſh.</p>
                  <p>What Numbers there are that ſhall be Saved, there is none can tell; for the Faithful, here, in the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, are, in a ſort, Inviſible unto us. But, They will, through the Divine Goodneſs, be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than ſome ſevere ones have been willing to think them.</p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:49802:88"/>
                  <p>With more Charity unto Men, and more Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto God's Mercy, <hi>which is over all his Works,</hi> we may truſt, that God will not permit the Work of his own Hands, and the purchaſe of his Son's Blood, to be ſo much deſtroy'd, ſince he hath aſſured us he hath no <hi>delight in the Death of a Sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leaving the Number of Thoſe who ſhall be Saved unto God; and praying that he would every day increaſe his Kingdom, we may affirm, be the Number what it will, That it is better for their Sakes, who obey theſe Holy Laws, that the Goſpel hath been Reveal'd, than it would have been for theirs who Diſobey them, that it ſhould never have been made known. And there is ſome Reaſon to think, that the Happineſs of Holy Men in Heaven (how few ſoever they ſhall be who ſhall reach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,) will, in the whole, be greater unto Them, than all the Torments of Hell ſhall be to the Damned, how numerous ſoever they are. Becauſe the Merits of our Lord which were truly infinite, have obtain'd that Happineſs, which will be anſwerable unto them; when the Sins of Men, which, though great, muſt needs be acknowledged leſs than our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Merits, have deſerved thoſe Torments, which ſhall not be greater than their Sins were.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> what I would further reply to your Thought is this; to wit, that ſo dear unto God are his own Wiſdom and Juſtice and Goodneſs, and ſo much excelling all other things in the World, that the exerciſe of them through the Laws of the Goſpel, be the Reception of thoſe Laws among Men what it will, is better than the not revealing the Goſpel would have been.</p>
                  <p>God is the Supream Legiſlator; and, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Diſpenſation, he hath acted as it became Him who is every way perfect. If Men do not generally admit of his Mercy in ſo much Righteouſneſs and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49802:89"/> Wiſdom ſhewn, it is yet good that it hath been ſhewn: Becauſe he hath therein truly done the part of a Juſt and Gracious Lawgiver. And it is not fit that Mens not doing what was their Duty, ſhould have hindred what was, in all reſpects, ſo beſeeming Him. And, if for their Diſobedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Laws, they ſhall ſuffer Everlaſting Puniſhments, it is, yet better that thoſe Laws have been given; becauſe of the Glory of God's Juſtice, which is of infinitely more Value, than the freedom of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Sinners from pains would have been. Which pains, albeit intenſe and endleſs they be, Theſe Men do fully deſerve, ſince they have refuſed Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs no leſs (if not more,) intenſe, and altogether endleſs.</p>
                  <p>It would indeed have been better for theſe Mens <hi>Perſons,</hi> (as they by Diſobedience to the Laws of Chriſt have carried it,) that the Goſpel ſhould not have been made known. Not unlike as it was with <hi>Judas,</hi> of whom our Lord thus pronounced, <hi>Good were it for that Man that he had never been Born:</hi> Which is all one as if he had ſaid; <q>Better it would have been for him that he had never been Born, than by his Traiterous Infidelity it will be, from my coming into the World.</q> But though it would have been better for their <hi>Perſons,</hi> (as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no being is to be preferred before the being in Extremity of Torments,) yet conſidering the Whole of things together; better it is that even to their Miſery (ſince their Miſery is thus choſen by them,) the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould have been Revealed, than that it ſhould not have been. The Honour of God's Juſtice is hereby Magnified; Saints and Angels, who rightly ſee things, will diſcern the Beauty of it, and praiſe God for it; and God himſelf will have Infinite Satisfaction, from having done according to the Perfection of his Nature.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:49802:89"/>
                  <p>I thought it not amiſs to ſay theſe things, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus;</hi> They will not be your Injury, though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly not needful to be ſpoken unto you. And if you'll interpret them to that <hi>honeſt freedom</hi> I take with you, you will do well.</p>

                  <p>Such a Freedom I ought much to prize, which affords me Satisfaction in a matter which I durſt not ſuffer to riſe unto a Doubt. If it were ill ſuggeſted to my ſecret Thoughts, I foſter'd it not: And I have the leſs reaſon to find fault with it, from the occaſion it hath given of my being ſatisfied by you, againſt any ſuch thought for the future.</p>
                  <p>It hath furniſhed me, I am ſure, with that which directly meets with the impious Folly of ſome Men, (and thoſe too too many,) who are willing to flatter themſelves with God's being ſo much <hi>a God of Mercy,</hi> as that he will not deſtroy them, though they walk contrary to his Laws: Eſteeming Men to be more pleaſing to him as <hi>they are his Creatures,</hi> than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing as <hi>they are diſobedient.</hi> And becauſe <hi>God's Mercy</hi> exceeds <hi>theirs,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> could not find in their Hearts to condemn others to Eternal Puniſhments; They therefore are forward to think, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath threatned, he will not condemn them. But the Glory of God's Juſtice being, as you have ſaid, of infinitely more value with him, than the freedom of ſuch diſobedient ones from Pains can be reaſonably thought to be, doth utterly daſh ſuch untoward Imaginations.</p>

                  <p>What hath been ſaid doth indeed appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely ſtrike at theſe Men. For though God's <hi>Mercy</hi> be <hi>infinite,</hi> yet it is <hi>exerciſed with Holineſs and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which are likewiſe infinite. And He, who is every way perfect, will never lean to any one of his Glorious Attributes alone, ſo as in the leaſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the other. His Mercy is infinitely ſhewn in accepting upon ſuch gracious Terms Mens poor
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49802:90"/> Obedience to his Laws. But if they ſhall refuſe to obey him, preferring the Pleaſures of Sin before his Righteous Commands; Their being <hi>his Creatures,</hi> and <hi>the Work of his Hands,</hi> will ſo little prevail with him, that, though they were yet further commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by being the immediate Off-ſpring of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would ſooner, out of the Stones of the Street, form Men whom he might ſave, than ſhew Mercy unto thoſe who are ſo unworthy of it.</p>
                  <p>Neither do <hi>they rightly infer,</hi> That God's Mercy, which is infinitely more than theirs, <hi>will be ſhewn unto them,</hi> becauſe they themſelves would be ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to the looſer ſort of Men, as to ſave them, while ſuch, from the Puniſhments which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. A great Indignity they offer unto the moſt Holy God, in thus making Him to be ſuch as Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are. His Mercy is indeed infinitely more than theirs, but yet of a Nature altogether different. Theirs proceeds from weakneſs, and an evil favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin; And becauſe their love to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs is little or none, they would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore effect more for wicked Men, than God, who hath all Power, will do; or, if we conſider his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Wiſdom, more than (with Reverence be it ſpoken,) he can do. God is not leſs merciful than they, but more juſt; not leſs pitiful, but more holy; not beneath them in Compaſſion, but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above them in Wiſdom. And therefore let them not deceive themſelves with vain Words and Thoughts. God will in Righteouſneſs inflict thoſe Puniſhments upon them, which they, through a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Mercy, would have remitted unto others.</p>

                  <p>If it muſt be ſo only, and you will not wholly excuſe me, I will begin.</p>
                  <p>And, Firſt, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> From the Divine Laws thus conſider'd, we have (if I miſtake not,) a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>juſt Explication</hi> of that place of Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the Light of the World, he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but ſhall have the Light of Life.</hi> They are the Words of our Bleſſed Lord; and are to be underſtood of Him as a Lawgiver; ſo cleerly hath he in his own Perſon made good thoſe Types that were of him, and diſpell'd thoſe ſhadows of things to come; ſo excellently explain'd the Moral Law, and given a new luſtre to it; ſo throughly Reveal'd Heavenly Rewards, and brought Life and Immortality to Light. Hence, in the Prophet <hi>Malachi, He</hi> is call'd the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs;</hi> and in St. <hi>Luke</hi> he is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, rendred in our Tranſlation <hi>Day-Spring.</hi> But whether ſo, or the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or <hi>Sun-riſing,</hi> it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is a Title of our Lord; as having done that in Relation to Spirituals, and Good Practice, which the Sun doth in its Riſing, and with its Preſence, <hi>viz.</hi> put to ſlight the Darkneſs wherewith we were encompaſſed. And thus the People that Lived in Evil Practices, and in Ignorance of the Divine Laws, are ſaid <hi>to ſit in Darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49802:91"/> Mat.</hi> 4.16. and, from our Lords coming, are ſaid <hi>to ſee great Light,</hi> and <hi>to have Light ſprung up unto them.</hi> Which muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of his inſtructing them; giving them Laws, and revealing unto them Eternal Rewards for the quickning their Obedience thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And this, poſſibly, may give us ſome inſight into that place of Scripture alſo. Which hath been ſo difficult unto, and, in a ſort, the Torture of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Chriſt being put to Death in the Fleſh, but quickned by the Spirit; by which alſo he went and Preached to the Souls in PRISON, i. e.</hi> to thoſe whoſe Souls within them were, through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Evil Practice, as <hi>in the Darkneſs of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> The Light of Nature being almoſt quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct: To Theſe, He, through the Spirit, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Mouth of <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By his Laws it is therefore, and by other things upon their account Revealed, <hi>that Chriſt is the Light of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, after the ſame manner, is <hi>God the Father</hi> ſaid to <hi>be Light;</hi> as having by theſe Laws, through Jeſus Chriſt, ſhewn what He Himſelf is, what he chiefly and moſt earneſtly doth Will, Deſire, and Love; inſomuch that we cannot likely be miſtaken in his Nature, unleſs we will be ſo, either through Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs or Negligence.</p>
                  <p>Should any of thoſe Heathens, who, in Relation to Human Welfare, had undervaluing Opinions of the Deity, have read theſe Laws, with the Ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Encouragements annexed unto them, they, when they had ſeen the <hi>greateſt Proſperity</hi> to have its <hi>allays</hi> of Trouble; and <hi>all Men</hi> ſooner or later <hi>to Die,</hi> could not any longer have thought, that God, out of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>ill Nature,</hi> would not permit an <hi>unmixt Happineſs</hi> in this World; or that he <hi>would keep Immortality to himſelf,</hi> as by no means enduring
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49802:92"/> that any ſhould be partakers of it with him. It is but the due conſidering theſe Sacred Precepts, as they proceed from our Lords being given into the World, and God cannot but be confeſſed by us to be (as under the Goſpel he ſtyles himſelf,) <hi>Love;</hi> and with the cleareſt Light all the perfections of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy will be diſcerned in him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence alſo we may</hi> (as I think,) not <hi>untruly gather the reaſon, why Miracles,</hi> by which theſe Laws were eſtabliſhed, <hi>were confined to the firſt Ages of the Church.</hi> So great is the Perfection, and Excellency of Chriſt's Laws, that now they are known they do not need ſuch props to ſuſtain them. They have inward Beauty enough to recommend them; and they carry (as I may ſo ſpeak,) Marks in their own Foreheads to Teſtifie their Truth and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>Miracles, at the firſt, were indeed neceſſary <hi>in reſpect of Thoſe who ſpread the Goſpel;</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that they were to Combate with all Religions in the World; and ſo, were to be aided with a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit: i. e.</hi> with a Power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles; by which they might be encouraged to carry on a work of ſo great difficulty.</p>
                  <p>And then, <hi>in reſpect of Others alſo,</hi> to whom this Goſpel was Preached, Miracles were neceſſary: To ſhew that this Goſpel was Divine; and not to be meanly thought of becauſe it was New, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Religions they had been uſed unto.</p>
                  <p>But now, there having been Time and Leiſure for it to be known, from <hi>its Goodneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which always, though inviſibly, attends it, it will ſtand in the World: And, content with the Fame of Old Miracles, it, without the help of News ones, will conſtitute ſuch a Church, <hi>as that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Neither will it, in humble and well temper'd Hearts and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49802:92"/> Affections, have a leſs eaſie entrance, or a leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere entertainment now, from its Pureneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, than at firſt it had when mighty Signs and Wonders made way for it.</p>

                  <p>And may we not alſo hence infer, that Prophecy to be made good, which ſaid, <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf and the young Lyon, and the Fatling together?</hi> In ſo much Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Wiſdom, are theſe Laws of Jeſus Chriſt made, that the Tempers and Diſpoſitions of Men which are different as the Wolf and the Lamb, the Leopard and the Kid, the Calf and young Lyon, ſhall, if they will ſincerely ſubmit themſelves to the Scepter of Chriſt, be united and reconciled.</p>
                  <p>He that is Proud and Lofty, ſhall be taught to be Meek and Lowly. He that breathes nothing but Hatred and Enmity, ſhall be inſtructed to love all Men, yea, even his Enemies; and this upon a moſt rational and excellent account. He that is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and covetous, and would not abſtain from enriching himſelf, though it were by the Tears of the Orphans and Widows, ſhall be learnt to pray for the Welfare of others, to rejoyce in the Bleſſings which God beſtows upon them, and freely to part with his own for the relief of his poor Brethren. All ſweetneſs of Nature, all love and ſincere Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will theſe Laws of our Lord inſtil into, and nouriſh in the Breaſts of Men, unleſs they refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſhall ſtand out againſt their own Happineſs. And if they do, the fault ſhall be in themſelves; for there is no defect in theſe Sacred Laws, why they ſhould not obtain their bleſſed End. They only require of Men, to act as Men of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls ſhould do; and, without any Force offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do leave them the uſe of their Reaſon, and a freedom of choice. And if they ſhall refuſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49802:93"/> to the Laws of Chriſt, the blame is their own: But thoſe his Laws muſt be acknowledged to be throughly fitted for the making every <hi>Mountain and Hill low,</hi> the <hi>Crooked ſtrait,</hi> and <hi>the rough places plain; i. e.</hi> to render the haughty, the perverſe, the ill-natured, compliant unto Peace; and the pooreſt Perſons not too low to have a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and love ſhewed unto them.</p>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>And <hi>hence</hi> alſo, <hi>Eubulus, we ſee the great Goodneſs of God, in making theſe his Laws to reach ſo wide;</hi> there not being any part of the World to which they do not belong.</p>
                  <p>It is not now one Nation alone, that hath the Priviledge of theſe Laws beyond others. Neither is any <hi>Ammonite or Moabite forbid to enter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord till the tenth Generation.</hi> The extent of theſe Laws is correſpondent to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them; and they may be truly called the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven;</hi> not only becauſe from their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Purity they are a <hi>Lively Image of that Kingdom,</hi> which we believe to be <hi>in Heaven;</hi> but alſo becauſe as far as <hi>Heaven reacheth, they alſo reach;</hi> And thus the Kingdom of Heaven is explain'd by ſome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. and ſome other places of Holy Writ. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; i. e.</hi> Thoſe Laws, and that Government are approaching, which ſhall ſpread themſelves as far and wide as Heaven. Anſwerable to that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7.27. <hi>The Kingdom, and Dominion, and the Greatneſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given unto the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And herein conſiſteth the great note of Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the <hi>Moſaick</hi> and Evangelical Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Under the former, the <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> muſt be repair'd unto by <hi>thoſe few,</hi> of other Lands, who were willing to know and do Gods Will: Under the later, the Divine Law doth itſelf, (as it were,)
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49802:93"/> 
                     <hi>Travel throughout the World;</hi> and <hi>cometh</hi> even <hi>home</hi> unto <hi>thoſe many</hi> that are moſt remote; inveſting them with Priviledges greater than Theirs, who once were preferred above all the Nations of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Infinite Goodneſs of God, this is, thus <hi>to give the Heathen to be his Sons Inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Earth to be his Dominion.</hi> A Favour, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> highly to be prized by us, who are not to forget what large Bounds the Devil had gotten in our Gentile World. How Wickedneſs not fit to be divulged, was, in many Temples, the very Eſſentials of the Sacred Rites: And how, from the Examples of their Gods, the Votaries could infer a Liberty for the vileſt Practice. <hi>Ego homuncio hoc non facerem? Ter, Eunuch.</hi> So that it is no wonder, that <hi>Impudence</hi> was by ſome of them reckoned one of their Deities, and had Divine Worſhip paid to it.</p>
                  <p>And though indeed Chriſt's Flock in Scripture be <hi>called a little Flock,</hi> yet that, poſſibly, might have an immediate Relation unto the Number of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who <hi>then were,</hi> and were but <hi>few;</hi> and not to thoſe, who, in great Multitudes, were to be added to the Church afterwards. We read of Thouſands in a ſhort time won over to the Church, and ſubmitting to theſe Laws. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.4. we are told, <hi>that there was a great Multitude in Heaven, which no Man could number of all Nations and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, ſtanding before the Throne and the Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if Chriſt's Flock be little, (as too ſure it is,) in Compariſon of the reſt of Mankind, who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Infidelity, Profaneneſs, Hppocriſie, and other corrupt Practices, have little Relation unto Chriſt; it is not becauſe theſe Laws do <hi>not extend</hi> unto <hi>Them,</hi> but becauſe <hi>They refuſe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Goodneſs of God is not the leſs for not being entertain'd by the Generality of Men. Were it with an Impartial Eye look'd upon, it might excite
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49802:94"/> the Praiſes of all Men. That now <hi>every Nation</hi> is in the ſight of God of equal account with the <hi>Land of Judea. Every City,</hi> that will truly own and obey his Laws, is eſteem'd no leſs than <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and <hi>every Temple,</hi> where true Devotion is offered up, where the Laws of Chriſt are un-corruptly declared, and his Sacraments duly Adminiſtred, as highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by him as <hi>the Gates of Sion, and the Temple there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as he reſpects not <hi>One Nation</hi> before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo neither is He, a <hi>reſpecter of Perſons.</hi> The Poor Man ſhall not be deſpiſed becauſe he is Poor, but ſhall have his Obedience kindly accepted, and fully Rewarded. Neither ſhall the Rich be Envy'd or Rejected, becauſe he is Rich; but ſhall find our Lord Faithful and Juſt in the Valuing and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing the Obſervance of his Laws.</p>
                  <p>So that we may ſay with <hi>David,</hi> (poſſibly in a larger Senſe than he meant of Lands, Nations, and People, which in Holy Writ are often limited to the Tribes and Families of the Jews; the Regions and Cities of <hi>Paleſtine,) O be joyful in the Lord all ye Lands, ſerve the Lord with Gladneſs, and come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his preſence with a Song. Let the People Praiſe thee, O God, yea, let all the People Praiſe thee;</hi> For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given ſuch Excellent Laws to all People, <hi>thou wilt judge the folk righteouſly;</hi> and, with thy eſpecial favour, <hi>govern all the Nations upon Earth. Hear ye all ye People, give Ear all ye Inhabitants of the World; both Low and High, Rich and Poor, one with another;</hi> the Goodneſs of God is the ſame to you all, in theſe his Holy Laws; <hi>Praiſe him therefore and Magnifie him for ever.</hi>

                     <hi>And have we</hi> not alſo from hence, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus, an inſtance of Gods Wiſdom and Mercy, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe his Laws into Writing; and enjoyning the frequent Reading and Preaching of them?</hi>

                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:49802:94"/>
                  <p>What are for all the World, and do belong to all Nations how diſtant ſoever, could not ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently have been diſperſed for the good of all, had they been confined to ſome Mens Breaſts only. Whereas now, in their being written, they can the more eaſily and punctually be known. And from their being tranſlated into all Languages, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe Languages the ſame thing, God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed happily to reverſe the Confuſion of Tongues at <hi>Babel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had they been left merely to an Oral Tradition, we, by reaſon of the Paſſions, Prejudices, Intereſts, and (to ſay the beſt) the weakneſs of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Men, ſhould have had little ſecurity for their being preſerved uncorrupt; if yet they would have been preſerved at all.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtance is ſad, (but not impertinent to be mention'd,) how by this Traditional way, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and his Laws were, in not many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years after the Flood, in effect, wholly loſt; not retrieveable but by new Revelations, and the Conſtituting, as it were, a new Eccleſiaſtick State in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity; to which, for a not unlike Reaſon, he afterwards ſaw it requiſite to write his Laws in the Mount.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, how would they have eſcaped amidſt the Enthuſiaſms of many, who pretend unto fairer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations than any of theſe Written Laws? Which ſhews the great Wiſdom of God in committing theſe his Laws unto Writing; and may alſo ſhew Us, that no Laws, which are not Written, are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His, how Divine ſoever they may be pretended. For why, theſe ſhould be put in Writing for the ſecuring them from the corrupt Paſſions, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weakneſſes of Men; and others, of no leſs Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Concern (as is pretended,) than Theſe, ſhould be left merely to the Breaſts and Tongues of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49802:95"/> ſome Men, who are of like Paſſions and Deficiencies with others, I muſt confeſs, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</p>
                  <p>Nor is Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> leſs ſhewn than his Wiſdom; in that now, we are not to go we know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſeek the Will of God, that we may obey it; but have his Laws near us, and at hand, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place. As God ſaid to the Iſraelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.13. ſo may it now be ſaid to all Men: <hi>Theſe Laws are not hidden from thee, neither are they far off. They are not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, Who ſhall go up for us into Heaven, and bring them unto us, that we may hear them, and do them? Neither are they beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, Who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring them unto us, that we may hear them, and do them? But they are nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou mayſt do them.</hi> Nigh they are, and not a <hi>Family</hi> but may have them always lie open to their view; not a <hi>particular Perſon</hi> but may have them as a Treaſure in his Chamber or Cloſet.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth God only take care that theſe his Laws ſhould be made known <hi>by being Written;</hi> but he hath alſo commanded that they being Written ſhould <hi>be Preached.</hi> For thoſe Precepts, <hi>Preach the Word, be Inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort with all long-Suffering and Doctrine,</hi> are not Temporary ones, given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and, in <hi>Him,</hi> to ceaſe; but ſuch as are to be practiſed by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to the end of the World. They muſt not be negligent to put Men always in Remembrance of theſe Laws, though they be already known; but ſtill <hi>Line muſt be upon Line, and Precept upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; here a little, and there a little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A very <hi>great Mercy</hi> of God it is, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that he will have his Laws, though they be <hi>written,</hi> to be yet thus <hi>frequently Preach'd,</hi> that none may periſh
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49802:95"/> for want of Knowledge. And a Mercy it is no leſs, that though his Laws be <hi>Preached,</hi> he yet hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>them to be written,</hi> putting them into the Hands of every Chriſtian; That, in caſe Falſe Teachers ſhould ariſe, (as 'tis foretold there will,) we may have wherewithal to diſcover and diſprove them.</p>
                  <p>And truly, the having the Holy Scriptures in their Hand and Eye, is a Priviledge that one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſhould endeavour to take away from the People, ſince it always, by the Bounty of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd unto them. Under the Old Teſtament, the Divine Laws were to <hi>be bound upon the Hands of the People,</hi> and to be, as it were, <hi>Frontlets between their Eyes; to be written alſo on the Poſts of their Houſes, and on their Gates;</hi> ſo far were they from being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. Under the New Teſtament, we find that the Writings of the Evangeliſts were not compoſed for the uſe of the Apoſtles only, but for every Chriſtian alſo, in particular: As may, in good ſort, be ſeen by our Saviour's Sermon in the Mount; which was not ſpoken to the Diſciples as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but as private Chriſtians. For, at his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, there were no Apoſtles; they not being made, nor ſent, till afterwards. We find alſo, that all the Epiſtles (excepting thoſe only to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,) are written to <hi>the Holy Brethren;</hi> To <hi>the Churches of God that are ſanctified in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> And to all that <hi>call upon the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereupon we may diſcern, (as in a late Book hath been well diſcourſed,) that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, as it were, a <hi>Truſt</hi> committed to every Chriſtian; and he is to be ſo <hi>true</hi> to his charge, as by no means to part with it. Yea, theſe Sacred Writings are our Lord's <hi>Will and Teſtament;</hi> by which a Man becomes an <hi>Heir,</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt. And if ſo, then <hi>He</hi> that is <hi>Heir</hi> of an Eſtate, hath,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49802:96"/> ſurely, no leſs right to the <hi>Conveyances</hi> that make over the Eſtate, than he hath to the Eſtate itſelf. And therefore, if in common Eſtates upon Earth, it will be every Man's Prudence to ſecure to himſelf the Deeds upon which the Eſtates depend: In this Heavenly Inheritance, it will be every Mans not Prudence only, but Duty to preſerve to himſelf the Writings that conveigh it. The reaſon is, becauſe, though a Man may, without blame, ſomtimes part with an Inheritance on Earth, yet with That, in Heaven, he cannot, without the Imputation of Folly and Wickedneſs; and even the expoſing of his own Soul to Sale and Servitude.</p>
                  <p>The Pleadings of ſome Men, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Scriptures to be in the Hands of the common People, is the cauſe of Schiſms and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, would have more weight with it,</q> if, in the Ages moſt fruitful of Schiſms and Hereſies, the Learned had not had therein as great a ſhare as (not to ſay a greater than,) any others; and, if, where the Vulgar have, of late, in this matter, ſeem'd moſt guilty, we had not too much reaſon to believe, That even Thoſe, who moſt complain of them, have by their ſecret Emiſſaries, ſeduced them, on purpoſe, into Errors, and divided them into Parties; when otherwiſe they would have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſtraiter Paths, and been more at Unity amongſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But though there hath been, by ſome, an ill uſe made of the Scriptures, yet God, to whom Theſe Things long before were not hid, thought them not reaſon enough for hindring the Writing of his Will; or for the withholding it, when written, from the Hands of any. And his Goodneſs and Wiſdom is herein manifeſted, in that the <hi>ill effects</hi> which would have proceeded from the not writing his Laws, or the denying them to the Eye of the Vulgar,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49802:96"/> would, in all probability, have been far more and greater, than from the contrary: And the <hi>good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of their being written, and allow'd to the uſe of all Men, are, by the bleſſing of God, much greater than the bad Conſequences now are.</p>

A great many years, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, have paſſed ſince theſe Laws were given by our Lord; and a great many more poſſibly may paſs, before the Diſſolution of the World ſhall be; but yet theſe are the Laſt Days; becauſe we are not to expect another Diſpenſion, nor another Lawgiver: For it is <hi>He</hi> that <hi>will be with us</hi> (in his Laws, and by his Spirit,) <hi>unto the End of the World.</hi>

                  <p>To draw then to a Concluſion of this our Subject. I hope in the Conſideration of the Divine Laws; we have not exceeded the bounds of our Duty; by inquiring further than we ought to do.</p>

                  <p>I think, I juſtly may abſolve you from any ſuch fault, now committed. For though it be a fault over-curiouſly to pry into the Laws of our Lord, as if all the Reaſons of them were to be underſtood by us; and though, where we do not underſtand many things in Relation to them, we are to acquieſce, by perſuading ourſelves, that they are, in every reſpect, Holy and Juſt; yet where the reaſons of them lie open to view, or, at leaſt, by an Humble and Devout ſearch into them, may eaſily be found out, there it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49802:97"/> will be well-becoming us, and no more than Duty, to look into them: That the Excellences of them may be diſcern'd by us; and that our Love of them, and Gods Glory from them, may be the more rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and magnified. And indeed, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> in all your words I have perceived nothing but what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſo humble a ſearch, and ſo pious an end. And I acknowledge myſelf as much edified thereby, ſo likewiſe much obliged to you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>The Deſign of our Diſcourſe hath been good: And that, I truſt, will caſt a Vail upon what Defects ſoever may have been in it. And if it hath adminiſtred to your Satisfaction, or, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's words, but <hi>ſtirr'd up your pure Mind by way of Remembrance,</hi> I ſhall account its doing ſo to be ſufficiently my Reward.</p>
                  <p>A good Work it would be, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> if, upon occaſion, we could prevail abroad for a due eſteem and love of theſe ſacred Laws.</p>
                  <p>Men are apt to think, (and ſomtimes they may think right) that, in relation to the Commands of Maſters and Governors, they could do better than what they are enjoyn'd to do: And yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they will yield Obedience, as judging it but reaſonable, That not always what is beſt, but what beſt pleaſeth thoſe who are in Power, is to be done. But better they cannot do than that which the Laws of our Lord require. His Will never ſtands in Oppoſition to what is, in itſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beſt; becauſe he is pleaſed with nothing but that which is holy, juſt, and good. Which ſure may create a very great Satisfaction in us, whilſt we ſubmit to his Laws; and may render thoſe his Laws of very high account with us.</p>
                  <p>But yet, for all this, his Laws, and Himſelf too, are much diſeſteem'd; and the mean regard which they generally find, hath made me with ſorrow to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49802:98"/> think upon thoſe Words of <hi>Arrian</hi>'s <hi>Epictetus;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. But to Him who finds out, and gives Light to the Truth of Things; directing Men not merely to preſerve Life, but to Live well, and as Men ought to do, Who of you all Dedicates a Temple to his Honour, or ſo much as thanks God upon his Account?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this cannot, I confeſs, be ſaid, with relation to our Lawgiver. Temples are built unto him, and Praiſes are offered unto God who ſent him into the World. But are they not, with a great many, as an outward ſhew, rather than the Expreſſions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Devotion, and unfeigned Thankfulneſs? While they obey not the Laws of Him whom they thus celebrate; and (to uſe our Lord's own words,) do <hi>draw near unto him with their Lips, when their Heart is far from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt Men are willing to have our Lord their <hi>Prieſt</hi> to Attone for their Sins, and for Novelty and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, they can be content to have him their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet too.</hi> But as a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver</hi> they care not for him; and are backward to ſubmit to his Scepter and Laws. Yet ſurely his Scepter <hi>is a Righteous Scepter;</hi> and <hi>his Commands not grievous;</hi> but ſuch as are fitted to Human Nature, and its Intereſts in this World; that the Man may ſeem unwilling to be Happy, either here or hereafter, who refuſeth Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto them.</p>
                  <p>It was a true word of the People concerning our Lord, That <hi>never Man ſpake as he ſpake. His Words were with Authority,</hi> bringing a Convincingneſs along with them. And ſhall Men now be deaf to them? Frequently did our Saviour uſe that Exhortation, (ſhall I call it?) or Command, or both, <hi>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear.</hi> As much as to ſay, Of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49802:98"/> ſo great importance are the things I declare unto you, that if ever a more than ordinary Attention was requiſite, now it is. Well it were, if it could not be ſaid of Multitudes, <hi>That there is a Price put into their Hands, and they have no Heart to it.</hi>

                  <p>Let me add, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> that the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation which was of this our Lawgiver, and his Laws, may prevail much for Mens Obedience to them. Towards Him the Faces of the Jews, even from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, and upwards, were bent: The coming of <hi>Shiloh</hi> was earneſtly waited for: And He, after ſo many Propbecies made of him, had the Name of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And when the Ages paſt were ſo intent upon his Coming; when there were ſo many Types and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of him, which, under his Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokened the greateſt Happineſs unto Men, ſhall Men, <hi>now He is come,</hi> eſteem meanly of Him and his Laws? And this, when to thoſe, who will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially weigh and conſider things, He is not a jot leſs worthy than all the Expectations of a great Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for many more than a thouſand Years, and thoſe many Figures and Prophecies of him, imported him to be?

                  <p>NOt a few think themſelves ſecure in their actings, if they can ſhew that ſome good Men in Holy Writ, or ſome well accounted of ſince, have done the like. Examples of Good Men to be imitated no further than they have the Laws of Chriſt for their Rule and Warrant. They can of themſelves lay no Obligation upon us. The Holy Men we read of in Scripture, were not ſent into the World to be a Rule to all Others in the Things they acted. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty of Examples very great. Their Inſufficiency. None of the Actions of our Bleſſed Lord, from his Example merely, and without a Law, did lay any Obligation upon us to Imitate them. The Laws of Chriſt reach to all Moral Actions. No Examples of Goodneſs beyond what is included in thoſe Laws. Inferences concerning the Examples in Holy Writ. In thoſe things where the Law of God is Silent, Prudence is to be our Guide. Examples, though of themſelves they lay no Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon us, are yet of uſe. Thoſe which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49802:100"/> bear the Image of the Laws of Chriſt, are given us for Incentives and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Obedience. When Divine Laws are queſtion'd as to their Senſe, Examples, upon occaſion, may be Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of them. By Examples we may be inſtructed to do our Duties in a decent, and becoming way. Decency added unto Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may make its reward the greater. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are Registred in Holy Scripture for the Honour of thoſe, whoſe they were. Our Condition the more ſure, than it would have been, if we had had none in whoſe Steps we might tread. By comparing Examples with our Rule, we ſhall quickly find whether they will hold Good for our Practice or no.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Holy Men we read of in Scripture, were not ſent into the World to be a Law to all others in the things they acted. If we look upon the Patriarchs, together with the Prophets, what was there in them that might ſhew, that every thing they did was to be a Rule to the whole Nation of the Jews <hi>then,</hi> and to all Mankind <hi>afterwards?</hi> They had indeed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enough for the engaging Obedience to what they ſaid. <hi>Moſes</hi> received from God the Laws which he gave: And his delivering them with theſe words, <hi>God ſpake,</hi> or, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> or ſome ſuch like form, and confirming the truth of them alſo by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, was Argument ſufficient for their being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And the Holy Prophets, carrying Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their being divinely inſpired, might claim
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49802:102"/> Attention and Obſervance to their Prophecies, in whatever related to practice.</p>
                  <p>But what Authority did all <hi>their Actions</hi> bear for Imitation? All of them were Men of <hi>like Paſſions with us;</hi> and their Perſons were much of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſort from the greatneſs of the things they wrote.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſomthing in him that was worſe than his ſlowneſs of ſpeech; for <hi>he ſpake unadviſedly with his Lips.</hi> What failures <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> had; what paſſions <hi>Jonah</hi> towards his God, we know. <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who had the moſt Viſions of any, is more often than any call'd the <hi>Son of Man;</hi> leſt he (as is thought,) ſhould have forgotten his own Meanneſs. And St. <hi>Paul, that he might not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above meaſure,</hi> and that others alſo might not think too highly of him, had <hi>a Meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet him.</hi> And if we ſhould run through all the Perſonal Failings of Holy Men, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from their Example would be found to be little or none. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, and the other Apoſtles, <hi>We have this Treaſure in Earthen Veſſels, that the Excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us;</hi> ſo may it alſo be ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> They were but as a mean Cask to the Will of God, which was incloſed in them, and by them delivered unto others; and their own Perſons and Actions of no Authority in reſpect of the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which from God they declared.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty,</hi> Theophilus, <hi>of Examples next, will ſhew us that they, of themſelves, do not oblige us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many of thoſe Examples ſhall bind us to Imitation, is no where in Scripture told us. Some of them carry an open unlawfulneſs along with them. Others may well be queſtion'd whether they be rightly honeſt or not: And others that were
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49802:102"/> lawful and good in the Circumſtances they, when acted, were in, will be found not ſo eaſie to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our own, and all other Mens Circumſtances. For they admit of an unaccountable variety; and that variety may ſo much alter the quality of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to make ſome, that are lawful, to become ſinful; and others that we are free to do or not to do, to become neceſſary to be done.</p>
                  <p>So that either we muſt be told in how many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſuch Examples will hold good, and be imitable, and in how many they will become unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and inexpedient; or elſe every one muſt be left to chuſe what Examples he will, and to apply them how he thinks good.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>former</hi> is a Task that no Man will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; The <hi>later</hi> would bring in the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Practice; while ſome would take the bad Examples, others miſapply the good; and ſo all Edification and Unity would be overthrown.</p>
                  <p>And as the Examples are <hi>uncertain,</hi> ſo are they <hi>inſufficient.</hi> And indeed ſo far as there is an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, there is, in ſome ſenſe, an Inſufficiency. For ſhould they be never ſo full in themſelves, yet if Mens Underſtandings ſhould generally be ſo dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, as that they could not, through diverſity of Circumſtances, diſcern how to take right Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of their Actions from them, they would be <hi>inſufficient as to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we ſhall find a great Deficiency of Examples in Holy Writ, in that there are Thouſands of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are to be governed by Religion, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all our Actions are,) of which we can find no ſuitable Example in Scripture. I need not, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> give you nor myſelf the trouble of gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together many Inſtances of Actions to ſhew what I now ſay. Let Men, in the <hi>Diverſity of Callings</hi> that are in the World; and in the <hi>many Relations</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:49802:103"/> that they <hi>ſtand in unto others,</hi> conſider their own Actions; and amidſt all the Examples of Scripture, they will ſee themſelves <hi>left alone,</hi> not having <hi>a ſure Light</hi> from any of them.</p>
                  <p>Whence from the Uncertainty and Inſufficiency of the Examples, as well as from the want of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Perſons, no Examples are Obligatory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; nor to be imitated any further than they have the Laws of Chriſt for their Rule and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>But, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> wanted <hi>no Authority</hi> in his <hi>Perſon;</hi> and his <hi>Example</hi> was <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> and what <hi>Others</hi> Example could not do, <hi>His</hi> may; may it not?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>We will therefore conſider the Actions of our Lord; than whom there never was, neither could be, a better Pattern in the World; and yet we ſhall find that none of them, from his Example merely, and without a Law, did lay an abſolute Obligation upon us to imitate them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Some of them were Miraculous Actions;</hi> and, as ſuch, we are not bound to imitate them. For no Man is obliged to do thoſe things, which are beyond the Powers which God ever gave him; or hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to beſtow upon him. Such Actions as theſe are the accompliſhments of the Son of God, above all others; neither hath he, nor ever will he impart the Abilities of doing the like, unleſs upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſions, and for the obtaining the chiefeſt Ends, the Glory of God and the Salvation of the Souls of Men, when they cannot reaſonably be compaſs'd without ſuch Miraculous Actings; as at the firſt ſpreading the Goſpel they could not. But ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, none will be thought <hi>deficient in</hi> their Actions, becauſe they <hi>turn not Water into Wine; Cure not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes with a Word; give not Eyes to the Blind; Legs to the Lame; and Life to the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:49802:103"/>2. <hi>Some of our Lords Actions</hi> were ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from <hi>that Authority and Prerogative, which, as he was a Prince, did belong unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this ſort was his <hi>ſending for the Aſs and Colt, without ſo much as having the owners leave;</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with what he did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.2. As alſo <hi>was his driving the Buyers and Sellers with a Scourge out of the Temple,</hi> and <hi>overthrowing the Tables of the Money-changers, Mat.</hi> 21.12. Neither are <hi>Theſe</hi> to be imitated by us, as we are <hi>private Men.</hi> Whoſoever ſhall take away that which is anothers, without his leave and licence, and ſhall uſe it as their own, will be guilty of Injuſtice. And ſo, whoſoever as a private Perſon ſhall take upon him <hi>Magiſterially</hi> to new <hi>Model the Church</hi> or the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> thereof, he uſurps that Authority which is <hi>due unto</hi> our <hi>Lord;</hi> and is imparted to <hi>ſome only,</hi> who are <hi>rightly called</hi> thereunto. And he deſerves the <hi>Scourge</hi> which our Lord made, rather than any Praiſe for his Actions in this kind.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Some Actions of our Lord,</hi> are ſuch as <hi>belong to his Mediatory Office;</hi> by which he interceeds with God for Men, not in a <hi>Submiſs and Precarious manner,</hi> but <hi>by way of Covenant and Merit.</hi> Theſe we muſt not imitate. He that ſhall mediate with God, upon the account of his own Merit; as if he had done whatever was required of him to do; and alſo had ſupererogated, and ſo might claim, as of Right, a Reward to himſelf, and ſomwhat over and above, which he might impart to others, who have been deficient in their Duty, and could therefore expect nothing; ſuch an one imitateth Chriſt no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than to become <hi>a Traytor</hi> to him; and goeth about to <hi>ſhare in that Glory,</hi> which our Lord will <hi>not part with</hi> to another. Nothing but <hi>Submiſſion</hi> is to be ſhewn, and <hi>Imperfection</hi> acknowledg'd by <hi>us:</hi> For we have done in every thing leſs than was our
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49802:104"/> Duty to do; and ſo muſt account ourſelves leſs than the leaſt of Gods Mercies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Some Actions of our Lord are Moral;</hi> ſuch as <hi>reſpect Righteouſneſs of Life;</hi> and <hi>Theſe we are to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet Theſe we are not oblig'd unto <hi>merely by his Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Theſe are ſuch as may be reduced either <hi>to the Law of Nature,</hi> or <hi>elſe to the Goſpel,</hi> as <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly belonging thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe Actions which he did, relating <hi>to the Law of Nature,</hi> we alſo are to do; Such are the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God; the being juſt unto Men; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in our own Perſons, and ſuch like. But the <hi>Law within us,</hi> which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our Hearts,</hi> laid an Obligation upon us before to do theſe things; and ſo the Duty of performing them depends not upon his Example.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>thoſe Actions that purely relate unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;</hi> How had we been bound by them, unleſs he had ſaid, <hi>This I ſay unto you, This do ye?</hi> Or how could we have known that his Actions ſhould have been imitated, unleſs he had given Laws for the doing the like? When we had ſeen him reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bearing all Indignities without Endeavours of vindicating himſelf, (though he had the power of doing it,) ſmall Encouragement there would have been for our complying with his Example, had he not ſaid, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil; but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the Right Cheek, turn to him the other alſo, Love your Enemies; Bleſs them them that curſe you; Do good to them that hate you; And pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you; that ye may be the Children of your Father who is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, had there been only the Example of our Lord, without any thing elſe, we ſhould not, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> have known how <hi>to interpret</hi> ſome Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49802:104"/> But if in the Example which he hath ſet, <hi>his Will and Deſign ſhould have been told,</hi> the Matter of his Actions would have put on the <hi>Nature of a Law;</hi> and ſo, would have bound us to imitation, not as <hi>Example</hi> ſo much, as <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence I ſuppoſe, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> it is plain that the Example of none, no, (with Reverence I ſpeak it,) not of our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, do, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, lay any Obligations upon us; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our <hi>Imitation of Holy Men is to go no further than their Example hath the Divine Laws for its Rule and Warrant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Perfection of the Laws of Chriſt which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all Moral Actions, and even to the Thoughts of our Hearts, ſheweth us the ſame thing alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing is there that is juſt and good, but the Precepts of the Goſpel do enjoyn it: Nothing that is unrighteous, but is forbidden there. And in this ſenſe in is that <hi>the Law of God is ſaid to be exceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſay that there may be Examples of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beyond what is included in the Laws of Chriſt, is to make thoſe Laws imperfect, which <hi>pierce in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing even to the dividing aſunder of the Soul and Spirit, and the Joynts and Marrow;</hi> and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Him who is infinitely Wiſe, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to be any way deficient.</p>
                  <p>But to ſay that ſuch or ſuch an Example is good, becauſe it includeth in it that goodneſs which the Laws of our Lord do enjoyn, is to grant that the Law is Superiour to the Example; and, though there ſhould have been no ſuch Example, would have required the matter of it to have been done.</p>

                  <p>But pray, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> what ſhall we think of <hi>the Example of the Church, in ſome things which we account neceſſary to be done from her Practice,</hi> when <hi>yet there is no Command in Holy Scripture for the doing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49802:105"/> them?</hi> I will inſtance only in <hi>two things,</hi> though I might in more; to wit, <hi>The Baptizing of Infants, and the ſetting apart the Firſt Day of the Week as Holy.</hi> It may ſeem that either we are <hi>miſtaken,</hi> when we preſs the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of theſe things; or elſe that there are <hi>ſome things neceſſary</hi> which the <hi>Precepts</hi> of our Lord <hi>do not reach unto.</hi>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>But yet, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> even in theſe things <hi>we are not ſwayed merely by the Example of the Church, without great Reaſon moving Her to the conſtant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of them.</hi> And though there be no direct Command for theſe things, yet if they may with <hi>good probability be inferred from Holy Writ;</hi> if there be a <hi>Congruity in them to ſome Laws given unto the Jews,</hi> ſo far as <hi>Reaſon and Enquity enforced thoſe Laws;</hi> and if there be likewiſe <hi>ſome things in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that <hi>more than a little intimate the doing of them,</hi> we may obſerve them upon the <hi>ſame Grounds</hi> that the <hi>Church obſerved them,</hi> and not only from <hi>her Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Though truly her Example downwards, even from her Firſt Age, may add Authority to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations now mention'd, in that ſhe is a Society which above all others in the World, hath the Aids and Direction of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> who is <hi>the Guide unto all Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we look upon your firſt Inſtance of Baptizing Infants, there is a Command that <hi>all Nations ſhould be Baptized;</hi> God enlarging his Covenant to all Mankind, which was confined to the Jews before. Though truly, even the <hi>Covenant</hi> which was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> (of which <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was the Seal,) was of an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Nature, and belonged to him <hi>chiefly</hi> as he was the <hi>Father of the Faithful;</hi> and to his <hi>Spiritual</hi> no leſs than to his <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Race. And if Children before, and in the time of the Old Law were capable of the Covenant, why not in the time of the Goſpel, where is much greater Love mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49802:105"/> unto Men, than ever there was in the Jewiſh State? And while Divine Love is more abundant to all Sorts and Conditions of Men, ſhall poor and helpleſs Children ſuffer a Diminution in it? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when our Bleſſed Lord was pleaſed <hi>to take them in his Arms;</hi> to <hi>rebuke thoſe that kept them from him;</hi> and to pronounce that <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> There is ſo much cauſe to think that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Children are not only continued, but increaſed under the Goſpel; that to make us to be of another Mind, it may ſeem neceſſary that there ſhould have been a <hi>Command on purpoſe</hi> not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them. And what Prejudice, think we, would it not have wrought in the Jews towards Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if their Children, who were taken into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>under Moſes,</hi> ſhould have been excluded the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>under Chriſt?</hi> Or, ſhould it be ſaid that God hath Mercy in ſtore for them, as Infants, why, if the <hi>inward Grace</hi> be vouchſafed unto them, ſhould the <hi>outward Seal</hi> of ſuch Grace be denied them; who, if they be fit for the Kingdom of Heaven, are ſure not unfit for the Font?</p>
                  <p>As for your <hi>other Inſtance</hi> of <hi>ſetting apart</hi> the <hi>Firſt Day of the Week as Holy;</hi> Natural Religion will tell us, that ſome time is to be allowed to the Service of God: And Revealed Religion hath acquainted us, that God, by a Command to the Jews, (the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is fetch'd from the very beginning of the World,) had determined the ſeventh part of Time to be continued as his own Peculiar; The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of which Portion of Time, (in that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the <hi>Reſting of Cattel</hi> as well as of <hi>Men,</hi>) the Church ſtill owneth, as not knowing a better than what God himſelf had appointed.</p>
                  <p>But the Day of Chriſts Reſurrection, by reaſon of the Exceeding Greatneſs of Gods Power and Love ſhewed in it, ſurpaſſing that Day which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49802:106"/> ſucceeded the Creation; and having been ſignalized by the Apoſtles, and other Believers meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together upon it; not once by Chance; or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time as it happened, but frequently by Choice; Our Lord alſo honouring their coming together, by his own Preſence, and by the wonderful Preſence of the Holy Ghoſt ſent upon them on that Day; and its being probable likewiſe, that the Obſervation thereof was by the Order of the Apoſtles; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would not have been ſuch early Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as the Laying by in Store Collections for the Saints on that Day; nor would the Day itſelf, in ſo ſhort a time, have been eſtabliſhed throughout the whole Church, ſtill every Hour encreaſing; and further, it being no leſs probable, that except the Apoſtles had in this thing ſufficiently underſtood the Will of their Lord, they would not have been the Authors of the Change of that Day, which, for Reaſon of Equity, as well as Ceremony, was ſo ſtrictly obſerved for ſo many Ages in the Jewiſh Church; we may <hi>upon theſe accounts,</hi> and others ſuch as Theſe, and <hi>not from the Churches Example only,</hi> acknowledge the ſetting apart of the firſt Day of the Week, to be of great Moment. And the more, in that the <hi>Two great Adverſe Parties</hi> to Chriſtianity, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> were ſo rightly oppoſed hereby. In the Obſerving one Day in Seven, the firſt Chriſtians ran counter to <hi>the Heathens;</hi> by the acknowledging <hi>Him to he</hi> their God, <hi>who in Six Days made the World,</hi> and <hi>Reſted the Seventh:</hi> In the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Holy the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the Week, they profeſs'd openly, againſt <hi>the Jews,</hi> that they worſhipp'd God, not as a <hi>Redeemer out of Egypt,</hi> but <hi>as the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, who on</hi> that <hi>Day Roſe from the Dead;</hi> and was our Redemption in ſo wonderful a Manner, as that the Redemption from <hi>Egypt</hi> was only a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> of it.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:49802:106"/>
                  <p>In both your Inſtances, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> there is indeed the Practice of the Church, but then there is a great <hi>deal more</hi> beſide; ſo much as ſheweth, that in <hi>great probability,</hi> and in <hi>the beſt Judgment ſhe can make,</hi> they are things of more than Ordinary Conſequence; and to be Solemnly Obſerved by all who would ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely approve themſelves unto God.</p>
                  <p>And not unlike, poſſibly, may be ſaid in ſome <hi>other things</hi> which we have the <hi>Church's Example for,</hi> but no poſitive Command from God: For her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is founded upon ſuch Rational and Religious Conſiderations, and ſo Conſonant unto the Divine Laws, as do affix very much <hi>Honour to her Practice;</hi> and do Recommend it as neceſſary, if not in the <hi>Higheſt Degree,</hi> yet ſo as not to be <hi>diſobey'd by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> nor <hi>thrown off by Her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that we may conclude, that in the imitating of any Example, we are to have reſpect to <hi>the Law, and to the Teſtimony;</hi> to Examine it, whether it be Repugnant to the Rule or not, If it be Repugnant thereunto, how Specious ſoever it may ſeem, and how much ſoever Cried up it be, we muſt by no means imitate it. The Perfection of the Goſpel Laws forbids it.</p>

                  <p>There is no need of ſaying any thing of thoſe <hi>Actions</hi> which in Holy Scripture are <hi>Sentenced as Evil ones.</hi> How good ſoever the Actors otherwiſe have been, ſuch their Doings have evidently been Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Gods Law, and ſo are by no means to be imitated.</p>
                  <p>But then for other Examples we may ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Thoſe which have <hi>no Mark of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion put upon them, are not thereby preſently to be drawn into Imitation.</hi> For Holy Penmen ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Faithful Hiſtorians, in delivering Matters truly, but not taking upon them the Perſons of Judges, in Condemning every thing that is amiſs, ſome of theſe Actions poſſibly <hi>may be</hi> againſt the Laws of our Lord. <hi>The Drunkenneſs of Noah; Lot's offering his Daughters</hi> to the abuſes of the <hi>Sodomites; Joſeph's Swearing by the Life of Pharaoh,</hi> and ſuch like, are not Condemned, but who will ſay they are to be Imitated?</p>
                  <p>Nor Secondly, <hi>are theſe Examples which have Praiſe given to them, without further ſearch to have our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of them were <hi>Extraordinary Actions;</hi> (as was <hi>Phineas</hi>'s Smiting the Man of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiſh</hi> Woman, in the Act of Whoredom, through the Belly with a Javelin,) and ſo, are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond the Time and Circumſtances in which they were done.</p>
                  <p>Some of them were <hi>Mixed Actions;</hi> only in one part of them Praiſeworthy; in the Other againſt the Laws of our Lord. Such was the <hi>Midwives Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> in ſpeaking of the Hebrew Womens Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>births, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.19. As alſo was that of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt Steward, Luke</hi> 16.8. A Lye there was in the One as well as Piety; and Injuſtice in the Other as well as Prudence. And we are taught that even the <hi>Glory
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49802:107"/> of God</hi> is <hi>not to be promoted by our Lye;</hi> and <hi>that no Evil is to be done that good may come thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Nor yet are <hi>thoſe Actions, which have been in order to Signal Ends, and by the eſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God have attain'd thoſe Ends, an abſolute Warrant for our imitating them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I inſtance in the Fact of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>his Mother Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca,</hi> in the getting the Bleſſing from <hi>Eſau</hi> the Elder Son.</p>
                  <p>A Promiſe God had made to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that <hi>the Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger:</hi> And on <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bleſſing of his Father, the Welfare of the whole Race which proceeded out of his Loins, and was the choſen People of God, might ſeem in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to depend. The Bleſſing is ſought for through deceitful Means, and is obtain'd. The Father, when he knoweth of all, doth not reverſe the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as ſeeing the Hand of God in the thing; and God confirmeth the Bleſſing to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>The Manifeſt and Strong Providence of God, in this Example, will not Authorize our doing like unto it, though in concerns (if ſuch there could be,) altogether as high and great as Theſe were.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon is, The <hi>Expreſſions of Gods Will</hi> through Chriſt in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are to be preferr'd before the <hi>Inſtances of his Providence</hi> in the <hi>Old.</hi> His <hi>Providence</hi> can order the irregular Actions of Men unto Ends that are good; and by them can bring about thoſe things which he hath deſign'd. But His <hi>Will</hi> cannot, by reaſon of its Perfection, command any unrighteous Deed to be done, as if his End could not be obtain'd without it. And His <hi>Will</hi> in the Goſpel being fully and clearly reveal'd by <hi>Him</hi> who <hi>was in the Boſom of his Father,</hi> and ſo knew his whole Mind, <hi>That Will</hi> of his is now to be our Rule, and eſteemed by us, in our Practice, before any <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:49802:108"/> of <hi>his Providence;</hi> either that have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, or that ſhall be hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This we may do; improve, ſo far as in us lies, the evil Actions of others, into the good of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and them, and to the Glory of God: For in ſo doing we ſhall imitate the Wiſdom and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, which is holy: But we may never do evil Actions ourſelves, nor encourage others to do them, upon the account that God hath made them ſomtimes inſtrumental to good Ends. For they are not in themſelves a jot the better for the having been thus uſed to thoſe Ends. God hath indeed in his Wiſdom well <hi>improved</hi> them; but in his Holineſs he never <hi>approved</hi> of them. And his Will in the Laws of his Son, is, and always will be, highly dear unto him: And therefore, in all caſes, how little hopes of ſucceſs ſoever there be, and, at all times, how hazardous ſoever they may appear, is to be ſtuck unto by us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Thoſe Actions which under the Old Teſtament were altogether innocent, are not all of them, without ſcruple, to be imitated by us, who are Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such, I ſuppoſe, was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>ſlaying the Egyptian,</hi> who ſtrove with the Hebrew Man, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Ehud</hi>'s <hi>running his Dagger</hi> into <hi>Eglon, Judges</hi> 3.22. <hi>Elijah</hi>'s <hi>calling down Fire from Heaven,</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of the Captains and their Fifties, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.10. <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>cauſing the Ammonites to be put under Saws and Harrows of Iron,</hi> and <hi>to paſs through the Brick-Kiln,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.31. And <hi>his curſing his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> as, in his Pſalms, we frequently hear him do.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe Inſtances, if not in <hi>all,</hi> we are to look to <hi>an extraordinary Spirit</hi> (yet not diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> State,) <hi>impelling the Actors;</hi> and therefore it is very unſafe to bring them <hi>to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of Life</hi> now under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:49802:108"/>
                  <p>It might juſtly be objected againſt a private Man that ſhould go about to do as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Who made thee a Ruler or a Judge over us?</hi> And <hi>Ehud</hi>'s <hi>Deed,</hi> how little Warrant is it for Attempts of the like Nature? We know whom our Lord checked, for deſiring they might do as <hi>Elias</hi> had done, with theſe words, <hi>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of: The Son of Man came not to deſtroy, but to ſave,</hi> Luk. 9.54. And <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Carriage</hi> towards the Conquer'd <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> who will ſay it may, to the worſt of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, be imitated? And his ſo frequent Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Enemies, may they not be ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a <hi>Prophetick Spirit,</hi> and to be <hi>Predictions</hi> wrapt up in the Form of a Curſe? But who now may pretend to ſuch a Spirit? And not having the ſame Spirit, how may they preſume to do the ſame thing?</p>
                  <p>Look we to the Rule under the Goſpel; and there we ſhall find the <hi>Precepts</hi> that are given us to be of a <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>ſoft temper;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that <hi>actuates</hi> thoſe Precepts in our Souls, to be gentle and ſweet-natured: Not unlike unto the <hi>Dove,</hi> whoſe Reſemblance he took, when <hi>he deſcended in a Bodily Shape.</hi> We <hi>are to Love our Enemies; to Bleſs them that Curſe us; to do good to them that hate us.</hi> And <hi>Servants and Inferiours are to be ſubject to their Maſters and Superiours; not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward.</hi> It is not unworthy Obſervation, that in the whole Goſpel there are no Precepts that relate to the carrying on a <hi>War,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if our Saviour's Laws be obey'd ſincerely on all Hands, there will be no occaſion for Fighting.</p>
                  <p>Now where <hi>the State and Laws</hi> are <hi>New,</hi> (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Lord in great meaſure they are,) ſome things that were <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>commendable</hi> under a former State, may not be ſo unto <hi>us.</hi> For <hi>theſe Laws</hi> are to laſt ſo long as the World ſtandeth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49802:109"/> the Laws that authorized ſome of thoſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (even now ſpoken of,) were only <hi>Impulſes of the Spirit for that time alone in which they were done.</hi> Yea, <hi>the Laws</hi> which were moſt properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Inſtitution, and endured the longeſt, were in great meaſure but in order unto our Saviour's more perfect Inſtitution, which was to come; and which is ſtyled <hi>The Everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> becauſe its Laws ſhall never ceaſe to bind us, as was before obſerved.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>No Actions of Holy Men, that expreſs not the Subſtance of a Divine Law, are neceſſarily to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if our Imitation of Examples, in Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, be to have the Laws of Chriſt for its Rule and Guidance, then thoſe Examples which do not any way expreſs thoſe Laws, although they be not contrary to them, lay no Obligation upon us for our imitating them. Hence that <hi>Poſture</hi> which our Saviour and his Diſciples were in at the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his Supper, ſince it was not belonging to the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Command of their Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Bread and Wine, and Giving them; and of others Receiving them at their Hand, doth not oblige us.</p>
                  <p>There is none can underſtand any Poſture from the Command, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me;</hi> and there is no Command on purpoſe for any Poſture to be obſerved: Why then ſhould there be ſo much Diſcord in the Church of Chriſt about it? It were well we could not ſay, Men more earneſtly contend about an indifferent Circumſtance of the Duty, than they make Conſcience of the Duty itſelf.</p>
                  <p>And from what hath been ſaid, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> we may ſee how great and dangerous their Errour is, who <hi>raiſe Examples ſo high,</hi> as to make them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Laws of our Lord, <hi>the Rule of our
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49802:109"/> Actions;</hi> when thoſe Laws alone, and of themſelves, are ſo.</p>
                  <p>Nothing, ſay they, is to be done, but what is <hi>warranted by ſome Command or Example in Holy Writ.</hi> Which, what is it but a derogating from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, to add over-much unto Examples; and to give ſome Men, who have their Eyes too much ſet upon Examples, an occaſion therefrom to take oftentimes a greater Latitude than the Sacred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts will allow?</p>
                  <p>When the Law of God <hi>is ſilent</hi> as to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Action, and doth <hi>not forbid it,</hi> it is to be ſuppoſed we are left at liberty to do, or not to do it. Neither need we ſeek to an Example for our Warrant; but <hi>our Prudence,</hi> with reſpect only to that general Law, <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God,</hi> is to be <hi>our Guide.</hi> For thoſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are not directly expreſſive of the Laws of God, aroſe at firſt from <hi>the Prudence</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents; and why may not <hi>We,</hi> upon the ſame Grounds, do the ſame Things? Or why ſhould an Example be of more Authority with us, than that Prudence from which it ſprung, and which lieth <hi>in common to all Men,</hi> for the ordering a great part of their Lives?</p>
                  <p>Certainly the wholly excluding the Dictates of Prudence, where no Law of God layeth any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition upon us; and the joyning of Examples to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Divine Precepts, without any mark of Difference, as if they were of equal ſway with them, <hi>may be of pernicious Conſequence</hi> to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Men; and hath <hi>already</hi> been, too too much, <hi>inſtrumental</hi> unto the quarrelling with the wholſom Diſcipline and Conſtitutions of our Church; and the diſturbing of <hi>that Peace,</hi> which ought <hi>to be more</hi> among Chriſtians than others; but which hath <hi>been leſs</hi> in the midſt of them, than it hath been, even
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49802:110"/> with Thoſe, who, in the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s words, <hi>are Strangers unto Peace.</hi>

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>But if Examples lay no Obligation upon us, any further than as they have the Laws of Chriſt for their Rule and Warrant, pray, <hi>Eubulus, of what uſe are they? And to what end have we any thing more in Holy Writ, than the Laws thereof?</hi> Theſe of themſelves engaging us to all the Duties that any Examples can point us unto.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>We may ſay with the Apoſtle in general, That all the Examples in ſacred Scripture, yea, even thoſe that are bad, as well as thoſe that are more commendable, (for they were all ordered by the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Spirit to be ſet down there,) have <hi>their good uſes;</hi> and <hi>are profitable either for Doctrine, or for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, or for Correction, or for Inſtruction in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that the Man of God may be throughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more particularly we ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That thoſe Examples, which plainly bear the Image of the Laws of Chriſt, are given us for Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Encouragements of our Obedience to thoſe Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though our Rule be perfect, yet it will more prevail upon us, when it brings an Example with it, to ſhew that it hath been obeyed by others, and may be by us.</p>
                  <p>We are apt to think that our Task is difficult, and beyond our Strength. In Mercy therefore and Love, God hath been pleaſed to Regiſter the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Lives of ſome Men, to ſhew us, that what he requireth of us, is not impoſſible to be done. Why ſhould we think it an hard thing to have Faith in God, when <hi>Abraham hath believed in Him,</hi> and taught, that it is a Duty which may be performed by <hi>us?</hi> Why ſhould we eſteem it unreaſonable
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49802:110"/> to be patient in Adverſity, when we Read of <hi>the Patience of Job</hi> in greater Evils, than as yet we have ſuffered, or are like to ſuffer? We may Cheerfully ſet about the Duty of Mortification, and Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, from the knowledge of St. <hi>Paul's keeping under his Body, and bringing it into Subjection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Chief Example of all is our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt. And God hath required his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience both Active and Paſſive, not only that he thereby might Merit for us, but alſo that he might Manifeſt the Reaſonableneſs of his Laws; and might Excite our Obedience by his own Example.</p>
                  <p>Who can juſtly refuſe to be <hi>Meek and Lowly,</hi> when He, who Commands us to be ſo, was ſo Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though he were a King? Who is it will deny to <hi>Love his Enemies,</hi> when our Lord, who enjoyns us thus to do, did the ſame thing; yea Loved Us ourſelves, when we were Enemies unto Him? That we ſhould not be <hi>Weary nor Faint in our Minds</hi> under the Troubles that may befal us for Religions Sake, we are bid to conſider Him, who <hi>endured ſuch contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Sinners againſt himſelf;</hi> and <hi>to look unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing the Shame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what greater Allurements can there be, for our Obedience to his Laws, than that He, who made theſe Excellent Laws did <hi>himſelf</hi> Live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them; and was in all reſpects ſuch as he would have <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> to be? If his Commands move us not, how can we withſtand his Example?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>His Example is Strong: But may not the <hi>Perfection thereof</hi> (he being <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi>) make us <hi>deſpair</hi> of ever reaching it, <hi>rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> us to endeavour towards it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>In caſe any ſhould ſo think, God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us Patterns amongſt Thoſe who have nothing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49802:111"/> but what is Human in their Natures; and <hi>we are to be followers of Them,</hi> as <hi>They have been of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though truly Thoſe Actions of our Lord, which belong'd unto him chiefly as he was a Man, (ſuch as were the Expreſſions of his <hi>Meekneſs, Patience, Self-Denial, Affiance in God,</hi> and <hi>ſuch like,</hi>) we may imitate immediately from Himſelf; and have no need that any ſhould interpoſe betwixt Us and Him, as an Example of the ſame things. For who can Practiſe thoſe Vertues and Graces in a manner more befitting our Imitation, than He hath done? He was made in the likeneſs of Men; and was in all points Tempted even as we are; ſo that we may exactly ſee our own Duty in his Behaviour. Only He was without Sin; and though we cannot, while we are in this World, attain unto the Perfection of being wholly free from Sin, as He was, yet it is but meet the Copy which is ſet us ſhould be Exact and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: That thereby we might not reſt in Low De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but might ſtill be excited to riſe higher.</p>
                  <p>Nay, even thoſe Actions of our Lord, which proceeded more from his Divine than Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are, for the moſt part, not ſo much out of our reach, but they may yield us ſomthing for our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And they were not Written barely as Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, without any reſpect to our Practice. They carried in them a Conformity to the Laws which he gave; and we are excited to give Obedience to thoſe his Laws, in that while he <hi>acted moſt like God,</hi> he had a reſpect unto Them; and did then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the matter of Them, as well as when he <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt like Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Miraculous Actions, there were the <hi>Piety,</hi> the <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> which he requires of <hi>us as Men,</hi> mixed with his <hi>Power</hi> as he was God. And ſo far they are Incentives to our Duties. We cannot indeed <hi>feed a Multitude</hi> by a Miracle, but we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49802:111"/> can give <hi>Food</hi> to the <hi>Hungry,</hi> according to our Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. We cannot <hi>Heal the Sick,</hi> by a <hi>Word,</hi> but we can <hi>Adminiſter</hi> to <hi>their Neceſſities;</hi> We cannot make the <hi>Lame to Walk,</hi> and the <hi>Blind to See;</hi> but we can be <hi>Legs to the One,</hi> and <hi>Eyes to the Other,</hi> in <hi>our way;</hi> by giving Support and Direction to them. Unto this Goodneſs and Pity, theſe Miraculous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Lord do prompt us; and hence the Church of Chriſt, though it could not reach the Miracle of our Lords Faſt for Fourty Days, yet thought itſelf bound to the <hi>Piety</hi> of it; and as far as it well could, to the <hi>Abſtinence</hi> of it alſo.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe his Actions, which proceeded from his Prerogative as he was a Prince, (which I ſaid we muſt not imitate,) have ſomthing that may admit of an Analogy betwixt our Actions and Them: And may ſtir us up unto that Practice, which we as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are bound unto. Thus his Driving the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, and overturning the Tables of the Money-Changers, encourageth us to be <hi>Zealouſly affected in a good Matter;</hi> and to oppoſe every thing that is Evil, ſo far as lieth in our Sphere. Thus alſo his Mediatory Actions may be Excitements to us earneſtly to interceed with God for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Welfare of Others, <hi>in an Humble and Submiſſive way;</hi> not forgetting our own Meanneſs while we do it; and remembring alſo, that what we do in this kind is no more than what is our Duty to do.</p>
                  <p>You ſee, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that our Lords Example even in the Actions that are <hi>above the Ordinary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> as well as in thoſe which chiefly repreſented his <hi>Human Nature,</hi> is a Motive to Us for Obedience to his Laws.</p>
                  <p>I may further alſo ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> That not only the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſome Holy Mens Actions, in Sacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which, as to the whole were good; but Thoſe alſo, which, as to ſome things, are ſhort of the

                  </p>
                  <p>This is one end of Scripture Examples, which are Expreſſive of the Laws of Chriſt, to be Incentives and Encouragements to our Obedience.</p>

                  <p>Were it not to hinder you, I would give you my thanks for the good inſight into Examples you have already afforded me: But I will not be your let.</p>

                  <p>I had much rather your ſhare in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had been larger; that I might have had better occaſion to give the like thanks to you: Though I complain not of the Burden, if ſo you can find any thing of Satisfaction therefrom.</p>
                  <p>A Second Uſe of Examples in Holy Writ is this. That if <hi>ſome of the Divine Laws be queſtion'd as to their Senſe, Theſe, upon occaſion, may be Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may inſtance, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> in the Law againſt Swearing. <hi>I ſay unto you, Swear not at all, Matth.</hi> 5. Some you know do from hence Condemn all Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever. And therefore they will refuſe the taking of an Oath, though Solemnly by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, in things of great Conſequence, required to do it.</p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:49802:112"/>
                  <p>But that Swearing is not ſimply unlawful, but only as it is lightly uſed, and in ordinary Converſation, we have the Example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to teſtifie, who, to confirm the Truth of God, in his Epiſtles, doth ſeriouſly bind it with <hi>his Oath. God is my Witneſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whom I ſerve with my Spirit, in the Goſpel of his Son, that without ceaſing I make mention of you all in my Prayers,</hi> Rom. 1.9. <hi>God is my Witneſs;</hi> which is an appealing to Him, or an invocating of Him, as a Witneſs of the Truth of what he ſaith. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Now the things that I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</hi> And we have the ſame Reaſon to be aſſured, That theſe Oaths were as <hi>rightly made,</hi> as the Things which he ſpake were <hi>truly ſpoken:</hi> For the ſame Holy Spirit dictated both the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>Neither can I ſay, that we have not the <hi>Example</hi> of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> himſelf in this preſent Caſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.12. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, if there ſhall a ſign be given to this Generation.</hi> Which though rendered by our Tranſlators, <hi>There ſhall no ſign be given,</hi> &amp;c. yet it is obſerved by learned Men to be the ſame kind of expreſſion with that of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>As I ſware unto them in my Wrath, IF they ſhall enter into my Reſt.</hi> And with that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>As I live, IF their Sons or Daughters ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:</hi> Which is an <hi>abbreviated</hi> or <hi>imperfect Form</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> very uſual among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in theſe Inſtances may imply thus much: If their Sons and Daughters be deliver'd, <hi>Let me not be termed the Living God.</hi> If they ſhall enter into my Reſt; If a Sign ſhall be given to this Generation, <hi>Let me be accounted falſe, never, in what I ſay, to be believed more.</hi> What ſeeming Difficulty then there is in our
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49802:113"/> Saviour's Command againſt Swearing, here, in great probability, his own, but, in certainty, the Example of the Apoſtle, taketh it all away. And as this Law is cleared by an Example, ſo many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws in like manner.</p>
                  <p>A third Uſe of Examples is, <hi>That we may be thereby inſtructed to do our Duties in a decent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is not an unfrequent thing, that even good Actions may loſe ſomthing of their Beauty, by a leſs comely, and not well managed, performance. It is ſufficient, that the Divine Laws provide, that thoſe things which are righteous and good ſhould be done by us, and that the contrary ſhould be avoided; but they cannot be expected to go ſo low, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join all the Particulars of Decency.</p>
                  <p>Now herein the Examples of Holy Men may be of uſe; and, by their ways and circumſtances of doing Duties, may be a good light unto us, of more advantageouſly accompliſhing what we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> did his Duty, in his conſtant aſſerting of the Faith of Chriſt; But it was <hi>the Decency of his Duty,</hi> when ſtyl'd a <hi>Madman</hi> by <hi>Feſtus,</hi> he gave the Governor the Title of <hi>moſt noble Feſtus;</hi> (as if he had been obliged, rather than injured by him;) and with a <hi>calmneſs</hi> affirmed, That he <hi>ſpake forth the words of truth and ſoberneſs,</hi> Acts 26.25. With a leſs obliging Carriage he might have been faithful to the Religion which he profeſs'd; but, as he then acted, he added Comelineſs to his Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>Inſtances many more might be given, but Mens particular Caſes may better find them out, and more appoſitely apply them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, <hi>That the welfare of a Man's Soul</hi> doth not depend upon the <hi>outward Decency</hi> of his Actings, but upon the <hi>inward Sincerity</hi> of them;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49802:113"/> which of itſelf carrieth a true Beauty with it in the Eye of God, who ſeeth not as Man ſeeth. But yet it muſt not be denied, that even Virtues and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Graces may be more acceptable unto Men, when they are decently exerciſed. And if, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a <hi>Comelineſs</hi> to them, we can <hi>inſinuate</hi> them into the Hearts of others, and make them ſpread the wider, I am ſure we ſhall receive a much greater Reward with God, than upon the account of <hi>Naked Sincerity</hi> we ſhould do. <hi>They that turn many unto Righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the Stars for ever and ever,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Daniel;</hi> and a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in acting Virtues is highly inſtrumental to <hi>the thus turning them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Decency of doing Duties, is oftentimes learnt ſooner from the Examples of others, than from the lonely Dictates of a Man's own Prudence. And, poſſibly, with reſpect unto this, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Virtue itſelf, was that excellent Rule of the Heathen, <hi>of propoſing to ourſelves the Examples of Perſons eminent for Wiſdom and Goodneſs. Think,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how</hi> Plato <hi>would have done in ſuch a Caſe, how</hi> Epaminondas <hi>would have carried it.</hi> And to this End alſo Examples may be recorded in Holy Scripture, <hi>That we might thus be Followers of them, and might mark thoſe who have ſo walked,</hi> for a more comely deportment in our Duties.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Leſt the benefit of Examples in Holy Writ ſhould wholly accrue unto <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> and <hi>They</hi> who ſet us theſe excellent Patterns ſhould now have no Concern in them: Therefore,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>They were Regiſtred there in Honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Thoſe, who were thus Exemplary unto Others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> for her pious Action of pouring the Box of Ointment on the Head of our Lord, <hi>That whereſoever the Goſpel ſhould be preached in the whole World, there alſo ſhould this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49802:114"/> that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her,</hi> Mat. 26.13. In the ſame manner are the good Actions of Holy Men preſerved in the Scripture, that they may be told as a Memorial of them, whereſoever theſe Sacred Writings ſhall come, and ſo long as they ſhall laſt, which ſhall be to the End of the World. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall for ever be celebrated, <hi>who refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s Daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer Afflictions with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon. Abraham</hi>'s Faith ſhall never ceaſe to be praiſed, till <hi>Faith itſelf ſhall ceaſe,</hi> and be <hi>turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Viſion. Gideon, Barak, Sampſon, Jephtha, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> alſo, and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>all the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> ſhall, for their faithful Deeds, be had in <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Remembrance; Such Honour have all God's Saints.</hi> And though they be happy in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Recompence of Reward,</hi> and may ſeem not to need any of that praiſe which Earth can give, yet ſurely it cannot but be eſteemed an high Favor from God unto them, while they are <hi>Bleſſed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> to be <hi>Honourable on Earth;</hi> and <hi>Celebrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here, while they are praiſing God there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had we ourſelves, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> no uſe and benefit from theſe examples, yet their being Regiſtred, as an Honour to the Perſons that lived ſo well, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for their being written. Though, truly, in this their Honour, we may reap a great deal of ſatisfaction. For thoſe Righteous Actions which God hath ſo much honoured <hi>Them</hi> for, we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, He will be well pleaſed with <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> Since <hi>He is no Reſpecter of Perſons; in every Nation, he that feareth Him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him.</hi> 'Tis true, indeed, we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God will give Divine Authority to any more Books than the Bible; and write our Names in them. But He hath other ways of Rewarding Holy Livers
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49802:114"/> on Earth, beſides enrolling them in a Sacred Volume that ſhall laſt as long as the World. He can give us Honour and Proſperity while we Live; and can Embalm us alſo in a laſting Name when we are dead. And though he ſhould not do this; yet we read of <hi>another Book of God,</hi> in which the Names, and all the good Actions of Faithful Men are recorded; and which at the laſt day will be opened, when <hi>every man ſhall receive according to his works.</hi> The Righteous Deeds of Holy Men, being preſerved in the <hi>Books of Scripture,</hi> may put us in mind of this <hi>other Book:</hi> And the Honour which they have of being never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in this world, encourageth us to the like Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Juſt Actions, that we may be remembred in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>God grant we may at laſt be remembred there, and then I ſhall little care, though the ſame Earth that covers my Body, bury my Memory al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Though yet the Honour of Living in Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings after Death, and of being made inſtrumental to other Mens virtuous Deeds, and to the more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performing of them, I acknowledge to be very great. And ſince God is pleaſed to make a Good Name, and the Being, for Ages, Exemplary, to be a Reward of a well-led Life, I will not blame Thoſe, why by rightly ordering their Lives, have an Eye to ſuch a Reward.</p>

                  <p>I am ſure we have a great deal of Reaſon to account it a Bleſſing, that we have had ſo many patterns of Virtue ſet us; by which we are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter capacitated for being Happy ourſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo Examples unto others.</p>
                  <p>The Faith indeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is thought by ſome to have been the more excellent, and even to have given him the Name of <hi>the Father of the Faithful,</hi> upon the account that he had no <hi>precedent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of any ones Believing in God; He dwelling in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49802:115"/> 
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r of the Chaldees,</hi> where they were all Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing this were ſo; and that therefore our Faith cannot have the accompliſhment of Father <hi>Abrahams,</hi> becauſe we have Him and many Others our Examples; Yet our Condition, in our Faith, is much the more ſure unto us than it would have been, if we had had none in whoſe ſteps we might tread. For who of us would have done as <hi>Abraham</hi> did? We may therefore praiſe God, in that he hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us to be Born into the World after ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſons, whoſe Examples may direct us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than of our Selves we could have gone. And albeit we ſhall not have the Honour to receive others into our <hi>Boſome,</hi> when in Heaven, as <hi>Abraham</hi> doth; yet if we can the more eaſily have a place <hi>in his;</hi> and be our Selves, in ſome meaſure, Leaders of other Men thither, we ſhall have no reaſon to complain of any want of Happineſs; but a great deal of cauſe to rejoyce that the way to Heaven was made ſo plain; and that we had ſo many encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements in it not to faint. And with reference unto this, The <hi>Church</hi> hath piouſly ordered <hi>that we ſhould bleſs Gods H.

                  <p>A great Eſteem and Love, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> we may have for the Examples of Holy Men; but it muſt at laſt <hi>End</hi> in the <hi>Eſteem and Love</hi> of the Laws of Chriſt; which include in them all the Good that the beſt Examples of Men ever have ſhewn, or can ſhew.</p>

                  <speaker>Eubulus.</speaker>
                  <p>It muſt ſo, <hi>Theophilus;</hi> For all thoſe actions of Men and Women famous in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; The Practice of Righteouſneſs and Mercy; of Munificence and Liberality; of Temperance and Sobriety; of unfeigned Devotion and Piety towards God (all of which, every Man hath a Tongue to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49802:115"/> praiſe,) are but imperfect draughts of theſe Holy Laws. I ſay, imperfect Draughts; Becauſe no Man (our Bleſſed Lord alone excepted,) hath ever yet ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to that height of Excellence, which they require. Very pleaſing they are, as they are repreſented in the Lives of Good Men; though they there are not unlike a Beautiful Face, drawn to great diſadvantage; and with many unbecoming Shades. But could we ſee them without failure, expreſt in the demeanor of any Man, and had <hi>Eyes clear</hi> enough to behold them, we ſhould confeſs, that they were a Sight too good for Earth.</p>
                  <p>However, in the commendable actions of Men, with the imperfections of Mortality, if we would but reflect thus; to wit, The Conſtancy of <hi>that Man</hi> is a pleaſant thing to behold: The Righteouſneſs of <hi>this Man</hi> is truely Comely; Mercy and Goodneſs <hi>here</hi> is a real Ornament to the Actor; Friendſhip and Kindneſs <hi>there,</hi> How amiable are they! The Flouriſhing of Society in Peace and Induſtry, and all publick Virtues; The Affections and Tenderneſs of Parents; The Submiſſion and Dutifulneſs of Children; The Dwelling of Brethren together in Unity; And the Affability and Uſefulneſs of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to each other; Who is it can look upon and not be highly pleaſed in them? But all Theſe are nothing elſe but the Excellencies of the Laws of our Lord: And ſhall we not Reverence, ſhall we not Love them? If, I ſay, we would in the Laudable actions of Men, though much diſtant from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Laws of Chriſt, often caſt our Thoughts upon thoſe Laws; acknowledging the Beauty to belong unto them, which in all theſe things is really derived from them; it would be no more than a due Expreſſion of Eſteem and Love towards them; and, at the beſt, much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ow their Excellency.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:49802:116"/>
                  <p>Meet therefore, ſurely it is, when we have a Mind to do any thing, and have an Example of the ſame ready in Sacred Scripture, that we think not ourſelves preſently authoriz'd thereby to do it: Some actions, even of good Men, who are now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in Heaven, having not been always, nor alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Good. Let us make the Precepts of the Goſpel to be our Touchſtone; and, by comparing the Example with the Rule, we ſhall quickly find whether it will hold good for our Practice or no. Chooſe we either thoſe Examples of Holy Writ, which <hi>in the whole;</hi> or thoſe, which <hi>in ſome part of them,</hi> are the Image of a Divine Law; and thereupon have a perpetual Rectitude. Yet, in theſe later, be ſure to avoid that part of the Example, which is tranſgreſſive of the Command. As for thoſe which had a Warrant only for the Time in which they were done, they lay no more obligation upon us now, than Circumciſion and Sacrifices do; but are wholly to be ſhunn'd. And thoſe which the Law of God is ſilent in, and which are therefore mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent, we may juſtly eſteem ourſelves no more bound by them, than we are to wear a Seam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Coat; or to lye along every time we eat; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Human Laws</hi> ſhall, upon Prudential accounts, enjoyn the doing them.</p>
                  <p>And then for other Examples, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> not recorded in Scripture, They alſo are to be Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Rule. If in any thing they deviate from the Laws of Chriſt, we are not to follow them, though they be grown the Practice of Many; and of ſome who may ſeem to be more Underſtanding and Religious, than moſt of their Neighbors. Always bearing in mind, that the <hi>Beſt</hi> have their Errors and Frailties; and that the moſt dangerous Errors in Religion are, for the moſt part, if not always, uſher'd in with Semblances of Holineſs more than
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49802:116"/> ordinary; which to wiſe Men do often betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by being over-acted.</p>
                  <p>But the Divine Laws are in every reſpect ſincere and perfect; and will lead us into no paths but ſuch as will undoubtedly bring us unto Happineſs. They have no Intereſt to ſet up beſides the Glory of God, and the everlaſting Welfare of Souls: And will bear the being ſearch'd into themſelves, as well as they require that other things be proved by them. We may, through them, find out the failures of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecious Actions, and Pretences; but may deſpair in any example to ſee thoſe Excellences, which are not in far greater meaſures in <hi>Them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Thus, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> as well as I could, I have anſwered your Requeſt. In the doing of which, I cannot reaſonably be thought to have detracted any thing from Sacred Examples, by having made them wholly dependent on Sacred Laws. Were there ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a greater Caution uſed <hi>in Thoſe,</hi> and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Love ſhewed <hi>to Theſe,</hi> Men would walk more Surely Themſelves, and would ſet far better Copies unto Others.</p>

                  <p>I dare ſay, none of thoſe Holy Men, who have left us their good Examples, would think thoſe good Examples injured by what you have ſaid: Since their <hi>greateſt Care, in them,</hi> was to obey God's Law: And their <hi>greateſt Pleaſure, from them,</hi> was to have done it.</p>
                  <p>This your kindneſs, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> together with your other, ſhall, I hope, find that Entertainment with me, which you would wiſh: And, among the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which they tend to promote, I will ſee that Friendſhip and Gratitude ſhall not be wanting.</p>

                  <p>COncerning the Divine Law, as taken in a larger Senſe. Of the Hiſtorical part of Scripture; particularly of the Creation. All other Opinions concerning the Being of the World are cold and unaffecting. Of the Fall of Man. It gives Light to many things; which otherwiſe we ſhould never have known the reaſon of. The ſad effects of our Fall are in great meaſure corrected by God's Mercy, and made Comfortable to us. Many things in the dark, and mingled with falſities in profane Authors, we may from hence more clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Sacred Hiſtory ſhews forth God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand; and plainly tells us, that he puniſhed and rewarded, for ſuch and ſuch reaſons. Of the Hiſtory of our Redemption. How wonderful it is; and what a Sacredneſs runs through all the Circumſtances of our Lord's Conception, Birth, Life, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcenſion. The great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe things. Of the Prophetical part of Scripture. Eſpecially of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies relating to our Bleſſed Saviour. As
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49802:117"/> Divine Truth is eminently ſeen in all of them; ſo the quick and various workings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for the fulfilling of ſome of them, are very delightful. The Predictions of the Heathen Oracles much different from theſe. The Sibyllin Prophecies of ſuſpected Credit. Of the Adhortative part of Holy Writ. God hath uſed the moſt taking words for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with Men for Obedience. In the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there is nothing wanting, that may work upon the Soul of Man. Of the Devotional part of Sacred Scripture. It conſiſteth of ſuch Services were fit for Men to pay unto their God; and needed not Secreſie to ſhelter them from an Honeſt Ear, or Chaſt Eye. Devotion raiſed to a much greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by having our Lord and the Holy Spirit ſo nearly concerned in it. Thoſe perſons quite miſtake what they read in Sacred Scripture, who find a pleaſure therein without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Divine Law, properly as ſuch. What we are to think of thoſe, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly Obedient to the Divine Law, but yet find not that Delight therein, which Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things do frequently give them; and who hereupon are very apt to interpret their Love to God's Precepts to be unſincere, and ſuch as will be rejected. The great reaſonableneſs and Benefit of Holy Meditation.</p>

                  <p>That the accounts of things are Faithful, and Written with a deſign of Truth, the Holy Writers not ſparing themſelves, but putting down their own faults, (as ſeveral of them in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do,) is a very great Evidence. Such an Integrity cannot but be Loved, where from Hiſtorians having leſs reſpect to their own Reputation, than to the verity of things, a Man may be as well ſatisfied in his knowledge of the moſt Ancient Times, as he is in thoſe which he Lives in, and ſees with his Eyes.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſuch Hiſtory may much the more engage his Love, when it gives him not merely the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the firſt Times, but <hi>ſuch a knowledge</hi> as, to a good Man, puts <hi>a Reliſh into All Times;</hi> and will make the years paſs more gratefully to the End of the World.</p>
                  <p>Look we, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> upon the account of the Creation of the World, which we may be certain was Written by Gods Immediate Appointment and Inſpiration, for the exciting a due Fear and Love of Him; <hi>i. e.</hi> an Obedience to his Laws; and what Delight may we not conceive therefrom? While
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49802:119"/> the <hi>Wiſe Men of the World</hi> have in vain ſought, how this goodly Fabrick of the Heaven and Earth, came to be ſuch as it is; ſome of them affirming it to be <hi>from all Eternity,</hi> the ſame which we now ſee it; others determining it to be from <hi>a lucky hit of Matter,</hi> caſually coming together into this Beauteous Form: We, amidſt their Errors, can pity them; and the more enjoy the Truth, from the Ignorance and Darkneſs which theſe Searchers have been in.</p>
                  <p>But as the knowledge of a Truth which they could not reach unto, may upon that ſcore be prized by us, ſo we may intermingle the greateſt Love with our Eſteem of it, becauſe it gives us ſuch a <hi>firm ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> throughout our Lives.</p>
                  <p>God who Created the World, did it not more to manifeſt his Power, than to expreſs his Goodneſs unto Men, whom he made to enjoy it, and to be ſerved by all things in it. And how <hi>Cold and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi> are the Other Opinions in reſpect of <hi>this Truth!</hi> Were the World ſuch as it now is from all Eternity, altogether without a Deity, or with no Relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, (which is the opinion of ſome Atheiſtical Men,) it could not give us the pleaſure of thinking that it was the <hi>effect of Divine Power and Love to</hi> us. Nay, were it Eternal by a <hi>neceſſary Efflux from the Goodneſs of a Deity,</hi> which could not refrain from the thus exerting itſelf, (as the Platoniſts hold,) where would be the Favour? For that which cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe layeth no Obligation upon us. And ſhould the World have riſen merely by Chance, (as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> would have it,) there would this way alſo have been the <hi>Total abſence of Kindneſs.</hi> For what hath <hi>Chance</hi> to do with <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> whoſe perfection it is to have the Underſtanding and Will along with it?</p>
                  <p>But now, in the Hiſtory of the Worlds Beginning, we can behold the Love and Beneficence of the Great
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49802:119"/> Creator; and with Pleaſure can Contemplate Him, who makes his Goodneſs to be ſeen in every thing, though Himſelf be Inviſible. So great a Priviledge is it to have the World founded in the Divine Power, Wiſdom, and Love, that one who knows thoſe things, and is a Virtuous Perſon, would not <hi>for a World</hi> that the World ſhould be without them. <hi>The Light would be a leſs pleaſant thing to behold,</hi> ſhould it not have been from Him who is the <hi>Fountain of Light.</hi> And what pleaſure would the Heavenly Bodies (whether thoſe which we term <hi>fixed,</hi> or thoſe, which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks,) are <hi>Vocabulo non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It muſt needs be yielded that ſuch Hiſtory is Worthy to be Loved, on the Conſiderations you now mention'd; and one Conſideration more may be added; <hi>viz.</hi> That though there be <hi>in ſome antient Authors,</hi> ſome things not altogether <hi>unlike to this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> (they, in probability, having either ſeen <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Writings; and ſo, out of deſign mingled Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with them, for the making an Opinion of their own; or elſe heard an imperfect Relation of them; and ſo, given us only ſome faint reſemblances of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49802:120"/> Truth, though the beſt they could,) yet none of them all do give that ſatisfaction to a Religious Reader, which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth. He having been throughly inſtructed by the Creator himſelf for what he hath Written; and having given Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation alſo of its Truth by the Wonders which he wrought.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not difficult to conceive, why, though even by <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> it may be inferred, that the World owed its Form and Faſhion to a Divine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, there yet is ſuch a defective account of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen of the Univerſe from the Philoſophers of Old. For they, however otherwiſe of good Knowledge and great Induſtry, relying altogether on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Works of Nature; in which they ſaw that ſomthing was requiſite for the production of another thing, could not imagine (that great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Omnipotence,) a Creation out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But it is a great ſatisfaction to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know that Nothing is too hard for God; and that it is but meet to believe, that He who had <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> in himſelf from all Eternity, could be the <hi>Entire Author</hi> and <hi>Conſerver</hi> of Being and Life to all other things. And <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Words, <hi>viz. God ſaid, let there be Light, and there was Light,</hi> and ſo in other things of the World,) were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions Worthy of his Almightineſs concerning whom they were ſpoken; as ſignifying it was no leſs eaſie to Him to make the World, than to ſpeak the Word.</p>
                  <p>That which in Sacred Story too quickly follows Mans being made in ſo happy a Condition, is <hi>his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from</hi> it by the Allurements of Satan. But <hi>even This</hi> (though ſad to relate,) gives us light in many things, which otherwiſe we ſhould never have known the reaſon of. <hi>As why the Earth is ſo much enclined to Bryars, Thiſtles, and Weeds:</hi> And why with ſo
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49802:120"/> much <hi>Labour and Sweat</hi> we <hi>muſt Till it for our Bread.</hi> Why Men are <hi>naturally Prone to Evil;</hi> and are ſo apt, againſt their Reaſon, to be led away by their Paſſions and Luſts. <hi>Why Women,</hi> in <hi>ſo much Sorrow and Pain, do bring forth</hi> Children; And why <hi>all Men muſt Dye,</hi> and are allowed, in reſpect of ſome other Creatures, ſo ſhort a time to Live.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are taught by this Divine Book alone; and though there have been among <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Wiſe Men,</hi> who have complained of them, yet they knew not what to aſcribe them to, beſide either <hi>Hard Chance, or Hard Fate. Mankinds Tranſgreſſing</hi> of a moſt equal and eaſie Command, and the <hi>Corruption of our Nature</hi> thereupon, and the Miſeries and Death that followed as a Puniſhment unto all, in that all had Sinned, being, in Tract of Time, ſo <hi>far forgotten,</hi> that ('tis probable to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,) they would <hi>never,</hi> by any of them, have <hi>been thought of more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however this part of the Hiſtory (as was ſaid,) is ſad to Relate, yet that which follows will give true cauſe of Comfort and Joy. For we are told, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents Head.</hi> Through <hi>That,</hi> we are reſtored again to Gods Favour; and from this early promiſe, I ſuppoſe, it is, that He is termed <hi>the Lamb that was ſlain from the Beginning of the World.</hi> It is through <hi>Him,</hi> that <hi>the Curſe upon the Ground</hi> is in great meaſure turned into a <hi>Bleſſing. Bryars and Thorns</hi> we can make a <hi>Fence</hi> of, for the ſecuring the Fruits they would <hi>Choke.</hi> No Noxious Creature, no Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Herb, but is of <hi>Excellent uſe for</hi> the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Man; and even the <hi>Threatning,</hi> of our <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Bread in the Sweat of our Brow,</hi> is no leſs a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> that if we Labour God will give us food. <hi>Womans bringing forth Children</hi> in Pain and Sorrow may be undergon with Cheerfulneſs, ſince They
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49802:121"/> (and all Men alſo,) <hi>ſhall be ſaved in Child-Bearing,</hi> i. e. <hi>by a Child which was to be born of a Woman.</hi> Death may Ceaſe to be <hi>Terrible</hi> to us, ſince of a Puniſhment it is made a <hi>Paſſage to a better Life.</hi> And <hi>the Shortneſs of our Lives</hi> in Compariſon of the Lives of ſome other Creatures, need not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of; ſince this is the <hi>whole of their</hi> Living; of <hi>ours</hi> it is not: And a few years in this World, are, in Gods Sight, a ſufficient Probation for an Eternal Life elſewhere. And truly the <hi>Corruption of our Nature</hi> may not deject us; ſince the <hi>Laws of our Lord</hi> (who is the Seed of the Woman,) being by a Divine Power ſet home upon our Hearts, will, unleſs it be our own faults, moſt certainly <hi>correct it.</hi> We hence likewiſe are certified who is our <hi>irreconcileable Enemy;</hi> how we are always to be aware of him; and to ſuſpect his <hi>Onſets,</hi> though He be <hi>inviſible to us:</hi> How yet, we may have <hi>aſſurance</hi> againſt him, in that <hi>his Head is Bruiſed;</hi> and, <hi>if we reſiſt him, he will fly from us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would be altogether endleſs ſhould I go about to remark all the Excellences of Sacred Hiſtory; which, who is it can throughly do? The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Things hitherto ſpoken of, could not have been known without it; and therein it may claim our Love; ſome other things in Profane Authors, which are in the Dark and mingled with Falſities, we, from thence, may with a clearer Light diſcern: And herein likewiſe it may call for Reſpect as due from us unto it. I will inſtance in few of many, Mans being ſaid, by <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phaedro,</hi> to be at the firſt <gap reason="foreign">

Heſiod's Pandora</hi> who brought <hi>all ſorts of Evil upon Mankind,</hi> bears ſome Analogy with our <hi>firſt Mother's being the Author of our Fall and Miſery. Niobe</hi>'s being turned into
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49802:121"/> Stone from Sorrow for the Deſtruction of her Children, may not amifs be referred <hi>to Lot's Wife,</hi> who looking behind her, contrary to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to ſee what became of <hi>Sodom,</hi> where her Kinsfolks (and not improbable ſome of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,) were left, became a <hi>Pillar of Salt.</hi> And <hi>Niſus</hi>'s Hair we may, with ſome allowances, derive from <hi>Sampſon:</hi> Theſe being in all probability the <hi>real Truths</hi> of thoſe <hi>Fables.</hi> And who will doubt but the reputed Sacredneſs of an <hi>Helicon and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> and the Rapturous Vein ſaid to be, by them conferred, did ariſe <hi>from the Well of Beer</hi> at which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in an inſpired manner Sung; <hi>Spring up, O Well; Sing ye unto it:</hi> The <hi>Princes digged, &amp;c.

                  <p>We further, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> may ſay this of the Old Teſtament Hiſtory: That the <hi>larger Lines</hi> of it do evidently ſhew forth <hi>Gods immediate Hand,</hi> either in Juſtice or in Mercy; and plainly tell us that He puniſhed or rewarded for ſuch or ſuch Reaſons. Thus the <hi>Deſtruction of the World by Water</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Earth was Corrupt before God, and filled with Violence.</hi> And the <hi>ſaving of Noah and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> was becauſe <hi>Him God had ſeen Righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in that Generation.</hi> The like was there in the overthrow of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and the <hi>preſerving of juſt Lot.</hi> Thus alſo in the <hi>affairs of Abraham and his Seed,</hi> the things of <hi>greater note</hi> leave us not to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret doubtfully,</hi> whether it was <hi>a Chance that</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49802:122"/> unto them, or was Gods <hi>manifeſt Power and</hi> Providence. And truly there are ſuch Contrivances from the Divine Wiſdom in the managing and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſome particulars of this Hiſtory, as if the Holy Ghoſt had deſign'd by the moſt <hi>artful,</hi> and <hi>ſurprizing Methods</hi> to engage our Affections. And when we read them we muſt be very incredulous, or very heedleſs, if our <hi>Fear</hi> of God, our <hi>Truſt</hi> in him, and other ſuch like Graces, be not ſtirred up, and exerciſed within us. It is impoſſible, a good Man ſhould be taken with <hi>any Hiſtory, ſo much as with this:</hi> Since by being Converſant in it, he doth not only, as it were, <hi>Live in thoſe Times,</hi> with thoſe Perſons who were dear unto God; but doth likewiſe <hi>before hand</hi> become their <hi>Friend and Intimate,</hi> with whom he hopes to Live for ever, <hi>in that City which hath Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God.</hi>

                  <p>Our Redemption <hi>in itſelf</hi> is a thing Divinely Great. But the Method of accompliſhing it, Who can ſufficiently admire?</p>
                  <p>Though the Son of God, who was to work this mighty Favour for us, from all Eternity, <hi>was,</hi> and, to all Eternity, <hi>will be, God the Bleſſed;</hi> as far in his <hi>Godhead</hi> from being <hi>puniſhable</hi> for ſinful Men, as <hi>Men in their ſins</hi> are from being <hi>acceptable</hi> to a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Holy God;</hi> yet there is <hi>a way</hi> found out for him to undergo <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment</hi> in our ſtead.

The <hi>Temple of Janus at Rome</hi> was ſhut: And no noiſe of War diſturb'd the Nations: This was the Hand of God, that He, who was ſtyled the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> ſhould then be born, when <hi>Peace</hi> was upon Earth. Eſpecially, ſince the Laws he was to give, were not to make their way by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Arms;</hi> but were <hi>calmly to be</hi> weigh'd; and for their Reaſonableneſs and Excellence to find entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World.</p>

                  <p>But there were ſome Circumſtances in his Birth, which were as remarkable for their <hi>Meanneſs,</hi> as theſe you have mention'd were for their <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> Such were his <hi>Mothers</hi> being of Low Degree; Her <hi>bringing forth</hi> her Son in a <hi>Stable;</hi> And the <hi>Firſt Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> of his Birth being made known <hi>to Shepherds:</hi> All of which may ſeem unworthy of his Perſon, as they are much of a different piece from what you but now ſpake.</p>

                  <p>Yet in them all, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> there is no leſs Wiſdom and Love ſeen, than in thoſe things which were Splendid and Glorious.</p>
                  <p>What if the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> was not great in the World, She yet was of a very <hi>Creditable Stock;</hi> of no meaner an one than that of <hi>David.</hi> She yet was of <hi>Spotleſs Innocence,</hi> and of <hi>Great Piety;</hi> which are, in his Eyes, <hi>who ſeeth not as men ſee,</hi> of the greateſt Price, and far beyond outward Grandeur. <hi>Such Humble ones God will exalt, while the mighty ſhall be put down from their Seat.</hi> And this was the Matter of the Bleſſed Virgins Praiſing of God, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in him; and will be the Praiſe and Joy of the Meek and Lowly for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Birth</hi> was indeed at firſt made known unto <hi>Shepherds;</hi> and they were directed to the place where the young Child was; But had the Angels in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49802:123"/> Heaven, and the Great ones on Earth been his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attendants, the meaner ſort of Men might have been <hi>diſcourag'd;</hi> as thinking that the Benefit of a Saviour was only, or chiefly there, where <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> made way for it. But now, Meaner Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo they be Harmleſs and Induſtrious, (as theſe Shepherds, from their Calling, and their keeping Watch with their Flocks by night, appear to have been) are ſhew'd to be no leſs dear unto God, than thoſe of higher Rank.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, his being <hi>Born in a Stable,</hi> and laid in a Manger, doth manifeſt alſo that He was <hi>truly Man:</hi> Which would not have been ſo throughly diſcerned, had all things been of the <hi>more ſplendid ſort.</hi> For where there is nothing but Grandeur and State, Men ſeem to themſelves <hi>to be,</hi> and are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to <hi>be called more than Men, I have ſaid ye are Gods.</hi> But the being of <hi>Human Race</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtion'd where the Condition and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are Low. The things then that are meaneſt in our Saviour's Birth, afford us as much cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, as thoſe that are higheſt. Let a Jew call our Saviour Mean; we will not account it our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; becauſe he thereby acknowledgeth Him to be a Man; which we ſhall always eſteem our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: We hereby are ſo pleaſed with the <hi>low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of his Mother; the <hi>poor place</hi> of his Birth; and the <hi>inferior Attendents</hi> about him; that we <hi>praiſe his Name for them;</hi> as being great aſſurances of our Intereſt in him.</p>
                  <p>If in <hi>his Life</hi> we read his <hi>Infant-Obedience</hi> to the Law; in being <hi>Circumciſed; of his ſitting in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the Doctors, Hearing, and asking them Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</hi> If <hi>his Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Solemn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> after it to his Office, by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt's deſcent</hi> upon him like a Dove, and the <hi>Voice</hi> from Heaven: If <hi>his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and his <hi>Conqueſt</hi> over the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49802:124"/> Devil therein; What pleaſurable Entertainment is there for Holy Thoughts! And whether we find him <hi>Curing Diſeaſes; Caſting out Devils; Feeding Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> with a Miracle; <hi>Laying Command</hi> on the <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Sea;</hi> and <hi>Raiſing the</hi> Dead: Or whether we read him <hi>publickly Teaching,</hi> or <hi>privately Inſtructing;</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Secret</hi> unto God; or appearing <hi>Gloriouſly</hi> in his <hi>Transfiguration;</hi> How diverſly may we be affected, yet every way with Delight!</p>
                  <p>Yea, if we look towards <hi>his Leaving of</hi> the World, when, in the Garden, <hi>he Sweat,</hi> as it were, <hi>great drops of Blood,</hi> under thoſe Sins which in a Garden firſt took Birth; If we conſider his bitter <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Paſſion;</hi> the <hi>Reproaches</hi> amidſt his Torments; and the <hi>Death</hi> that followed them; though we <hi>Sympathize</hi> with him, we yet cannot but <hi>love</hi> the Story. For herein, the wonderful work of our Redemption is compleated. Here we ſee a Sacrifice of more worth than a World; propitiatory for the Sins of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Becauſe, as Manhood was intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the Godhead, and made one Perſon, He was Infinite who ſuffer'd; and ſo paid our Price in a ſhort Time, which we ourSelves could not have done, but by an Eternity of Torments.</p>
                  <p>If we read on, and accompany our Lord <hi>to his Grave,</hi> we ſhall find him after a ſhameful Death, to be Honourably Buried; wrapped in <hi>fine Linnen with Spices; and laid in a Sepulchre, in which never any before was laid.</hi> And it may affect us with a ſecret Pleaſure, to ſee Him, who was Conceiv'd within a <hi>Virgin's Womb,</hi> where no one Conceiv'd in Sin had before lain, to be Buried, as it were, in <hi>a Virgin Sepulchre,</hi> where no ſinful Man's Body had ever been laid.</p>
                  <p>But what Joy may his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> ſtir up in us, after ſuch endeavours to ſecure his Body, if poſſible, from Riſing; and, when Riſen, to ſtifle the Truth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49802:124"/> of its being ſo. It cannot but delight us to read of Angels deſcending from Heaven, to rowl away the Stone before the Sepulchre; and to attend upon our Lord in his leaving his Grave. And it may almoſt be a pleaſant doubt, whether cheereth us the more, their ſo kindly ſpeaking to our Lords Friends, that <hi>Theſe</hi> went away, though with ſome fear, yet with <hi>great Joy;</hi> or their terrifying the inſolent Keepers, that through Fear <hi>Thoſe</hi> ſhook, and <hi>became as Dead Men.</hi> If we are taken with <hi>Splendor,</hi> we have it in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels appearance in <hi>Raiment white as Snow;</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the <hi>Reſurrection of many Saints; who, after their Saviour had left his Grave, came out of theirs, and went into the Holy City: and appeared unto many.</hi> If <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> pleaſe us, we have our Lord's frequent ſhewing himſelf to his Diſciples, after his Riſing: And though a Crown was ready for him in the Heavens, He yet cannot quickly leave Thoſe, who once had left all and followed him; but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues among them <hi>Forty days, ſpeaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe great and delightful things are ſucceeded by His <hi>Aſcenſion into Heaven;</hi> which is truly Great, and highly pleaſant to a Religious Soul; Whether we conſider the <hi>Cloud of Angels</hi> which received him: The <hi>Powers of Darkneſs</hi> which he led Captive; or the <hi>ineſtimable Gifts</hi> which he gave through the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: Gifts, which were worthy of him; and ſuch, as no one elſe could beſtow. And, what eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerneth us, <hi>Our Nature,</hi> which was <hi>Created lower than the Angels,</hi> is in Him Exalted <hi>far above them.</hi> And to our Joy alſo we read, That He is gone to <hi>prepare Manſions</hi> for us, That <hi>where He is, there we may be alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſure, if any thing in the World can entitle Hiſtory to the greateſt Love, may well entitle this to Ours.</p>

                  <p>Abundance more there is in the New Teſtament, which I ſhall not now inſiſt on, though it be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Delightful. I thought good to recount that which more immediately related to our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; becauſe it is of ſuch unſpeakable Value unto us.</p>

                  <p>In the particulars which you have given of it, I have more than once thought of the words of <hi>Seneca. Cum Sextium lego, libet omnes caſus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>care. When I read</hi> Sextius<hi>'s Book, I could even Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Fortune to do her Worſt.</hi> I have an Antidote there, greater than all her Miſchiefs. What was height o Expreſſion, concerning <hi>Sextius</hi>'s Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, is no more than Truth if applied to this Hiſtory. When <hi>Old Simeon</hi> had taken our Saviour into his Arms, it was in good earneſt that he ſaid, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace according to thy Word; for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> The World hath nothing worthy my Eye or Thought, after ſuch an ineſtimable Favour. And, truly, when a Man, with a right frame of Soul, reads theſe things, what can his Heart deſire more? How much may he be above all ordinary Joys! How much above all ordinary Griefs!</p>
                  <p>And yet, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> how much ſoever theſe great things tend to the compoſing of all irregular Paſſions in me, I cannot forbear the being very much diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when I conſider, there are <hi>ſome</hi> who <hi>look upon all theſe things as impoſture;</hi> and <hi>have endeavour'd to beat them d wn as ſuch.</hi> Surely were there no other Proofs, the <hi>Sacredneſs</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which all along breath in them, might ſhew them to be of higher Original, than what Deceit could reach unto. And could an underſtanding Man be tempted to doubt of their Truth, yet, me thinks, they ſhould ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon him, as the leſs to care whether any thing elſe were true or not.</p>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>But God be thanked, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> we have the greateſt proofs of theſe Things, for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Faith; and for its, and our Defence, againſt all the Oppoſitions of Unbelievers, and the Carnal Reaſonings of the World.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles go about to deceive the World in things of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Their whole deſign in making known the Goſpel was, ſo far as can be diſcerned, none other than that Mankind ſhould through it be happy. And what injury had the whole World done them, that they ſhould in a matter which ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned it, impoſe thus upon it; as they needs muſt have done, had they not been abſolutely ſure of what they declared?</p>
                  <p>Untruths, for the moſt part, look at the intereſt of the ſpreaders of them; and are always of a leſs extent; confin'd to certain Perſons, or Places, or Times; and are not ſuch as ſhall reſpect all Perſons, Places, and Times, ſo long as the World ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, (as theſe things manifeſtly do,) unleſs there ſhall be a <hi>moſt Envious and Evil Nature;</hi> or <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate deſign</hi> of <hi>Praiſe</hi> or <hi>Profit</hi> in the Inventors.</p>
                  <p>But neither of theſe can be thought to have been in Thoſe, who firſt publiſhed theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Not <hi>an Envious and Evil Nature;</hi> for who out of Envy would publiſh ſuch things as all Wiſe and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men would wiſh ſhould be true, if really they were not ſo? Who, out of Evil Nature would write and declare Laws to the World, that ſhould beget and propagate the greateſt Sweetneſs of Temper? An happy effect of Envy it would be, to ſhew the Unſpeakable Love of God unto us; and to inſtruct us in ſuch a pureneſs of Devotion towards him, as becomes Creatures of Rational Souls to exerciſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Creator, and infinitely Loving Father. To inſtruct us alſo in ſuch an Amiableneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49802:126"/> towards Men, as ſhall ſhew that they are heartily loved by us. Theſe things cannot be the Deſign of an Envious and Evil Nature.</p>
                  <p>No, <hi>nor yet of wordly Praiſe or Profit. Not of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> for they taught the way of being Rich towards God: Of laying up of Treaſures in Heaven; which was the refuſing the <hi>Mammon</hi> of Unrighteouſneſs, by giving Alms to the Poor, and forſaking Houſes and Lands for the Sake of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Neither were theſe <hi>Politick Precepts</hi> to Teach Men to deſpiſe theſe things, that the Teachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might be the more enriched by them; for They, by their own Example no leſs than by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, had ſhewed that thoſe wordly things were meanly to be accounted of; <hi>They forſook all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely they did altogether as little <hi>deſign Praiſe to themſelves;</hi> for all which they ſaid or did, they ſpake and acted for the <hi>Glory of God.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> they Condemned for <hi>looking after the Praiſe of Men, Matth.</hi> 6. And <hi>others</hi> they infixed a Note of Diſcredit upon, <hi>for Loving the Praiſe of Men more than the Praiſe of God.</hi> They wrote down Precepts for the avoiding of applauſe in our good actions; yea ſo far were they from the ſeeking after Praiſe themſelves that they Regiſtred their own, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions Failings. At the Betraying of Jeſus, <hi>all his Diſciples</hi> cowardly <hi>forſook him and fled, Matth.</hi> 26. And this is writ <hi>by one</hi> who himſelf <hi>forſook him</hi> and fled as well as the reſt. And St. <hi>Peter's denying</hi> of his Maſter, is at large deſcribed by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who was his Intimate and Friend. And the whole is approved of by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who had the viewing of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Writings, and (as is thought by ſome,) did dictate the Matter of them.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:49802:126"/>
                  <p>From theſe conſiderations, there is no reaſon to think, that the Penmen of the New Teſtament wrote Falſhoods, or things that they did not throughly know to be true.</p>
                  <p>Add to theſe the unlikelyhood, that poor Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (for ſuch the Diſciples as to the greater part were, and the reſt not much better,) <hi>could</hi> raiſe ſuch a Story of their own Heads; ſo agreeable to the Predictions of the Old Teſtament, and yet falſe; or that they <hi>would have</hi> done it, ſo contrary to the expectation of the Jews, and to their own expectation alſo, a little before: Who thought of nothing more than of a Meſſias, who as a King ſhould deliver them from their Earthly Enemies. Eſpecially, when Indignities, Reproaches, loſs of all Comforts, yea of Life itſelf fell upon them for what they Atteſted; and might have been avoided by their Silence, or denying it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such Evils</hi> might indeed <hi>terrifie Truth,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it forſaken; but that they ſhould <hi>encourage a feigned thing,</hi> and <hi>bear up Mens Spirits for the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Lye,</hi> who is it can imagine? Certainly no Man can with any ſhew of Reaſon do it: Who ſhall yet further conſider, that none could poſſibly be greater encouragers of Speaking Truth than the Apoſtles were in all their Writings; nor greater Enemies to falſe Speaking than They. For they forbid it under pain of Eternal Damnation. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt enter into the New Jeruſalem which maketh a Lye: And all who do ſo muſt have their part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone; which is the Second Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe many proofs, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Truth of Scripture Story; and whoever is willing, notwithſtanding ſuch Rational Evidence, to disbelieve it, is, I doubt, of ſuch ill Principles and Morals, that it is his intereſt ſuch Hiſtory ſhould not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49802:127"/> be true. For then there would be no Hell after this Life; which, ſhould there be one, he is conſcious to himſelf, would be very hot to Him.</p>

                  <p>But, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> the Prophetick part of Scripture is next to have your Eye.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>The Prophetick is, in its way, Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal alſo, different only in this; Hiſtorical tells you what hath been; Prophetick tells you what will be: and if it be fulfilled long ſince, and written, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into a more ſurprizing ſort of Hiſtory. We are much delighted in the account of former Times; and not leſs deſirous to know what will be in future; And when that which hath been predicted, cometh exactly ſo to paſs, we are the more taken with it, becauſe the Times to come more properly belong unto God; and we look upon it as his immediate Hand, if any thing be thus made know. And hence it is, that whatſoever hath the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, needeth nothing elſe to gain attention, and to ſet itſelf off amongſt the vulgar: who, in this reſpect, could the leſs be found fault with, were they not too forward to look upon every idle Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication as a Prophecie; till at laſt they ſee the things to be falſe, and themſelves to be ridiculous from their Credulity.</p>
                  <p>But if ordinary, ſhort liv'd Predictions ſhall be thus attended unto, with what delight may thoſe be entertain'd, which were of greater note; and which God hath ordained as a part of Holy Writ, to be Monuments of his Preſcience to all Generations!</p>
                  <p>I will inſtance only in thoſe Prophecies which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected our Bleſſed Saviour ſo long before his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49802:127"/> which may wonderfully delight us, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding exactneſs of their being fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>what Heart will not be affected that reads the Prophecie of <hi>Eſay c.</hi> 9. ſo very expreſs concerning our Lord? He ſpeaks of Him in it, as if he were already come. To us a Child <hi>is</hi> Born; to us a Son <hi>is</hi> given. Highly pertinent to him, <hi>in whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are Yea and Amen;</hi> and through whom <hi>God calleth thoſe things that are not as though they were.</hi> In which alſo, there is a ſtrange Propriety of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to his Nature. To <hi>us a Child</hi> is <hi>Born;</hi> as Man, he could be ſo; to <hi>us a Son is given;</hi> as he was God, he could only <hi>be Given</hi> and <hi>not Born.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Time of our Lords Coming ſo rightly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> (according to which alſo the Jews expected the Coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> about the Time our Redeemer came) may well be our delight; and the more, becauſe the wicked Jews, ſeeing <hi>Daniel</hi> to ſtand the Chriſtians in ſo much ſtead by his Prophecies, have, ſince that time, made a new diviſion of their Law into <hi>Prophetas,</hi> and <hi>Hagiographos;</hi> and have excluded Him from the number of Prophets, and given him none of the higheſt places among the others; whom they made to be of a lower Rank than the Prophets were.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Prophecies, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall bring forth a Son;</hi> Eſai. 7.14. <hi>And the Lord hath created a new thing in the Earth, a Woman ſhall compaſs a Man,</hi> Jer. 31.22. How pleaſant are they to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we read them fulfilled in our Lords, being conceived of the Holy; and born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother?</p>
                  <p>And truly the Prediction <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. <hi>Of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born at Bethleem,</hi> may move us with a more than ordinary delight, when we conſider how ſtrangely God's Providence was engaged for the fulfilling it. All that Taxing which was laid upon
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49802:128"/> the Jewiſh Nation by <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> and which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every one to repair to his own City to be Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may appear in a ſpecial manner to be order'd by God, for the bringing <hi>Mary</hi> unto <hi>Bethleem,</hi> to be delivered of her Son. It was a great way that <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were to go; From <hi>N zareth</hi> in <hi>Galile,</hi> to the City of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Judea;</hi> And it might ſeem ill to have hapned unto <hi>Mary,</hi> at a time when her Condition rather required Reſt, than was fit for ſo great a Journey; and this too (as is not improbable) in the depth of Winter. But God ſomtimes is accompliſhing his own Will, and great things for us, when Affairs appear to be croſs and unhappy. Yea, and can order the Councils of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at a great diſtance from them, to carry on theſe Deſigns, which <hi>He</hi> in his Providence hath laid; but which never entred <hi>their</hi> Hearts to imagine. And ſo it is here. We ſee no means how <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould have been at <hi>Bethleem,</hi> delivered of her Son there, had not the Taxation at that very Time been enjoyn'd. Which may ſhew that She and <hi>Joſeph</hi> had no Thoughts of fulfilling a Prophecy by their journey thither. But hence it was, <hi>that the Son of David was born in the City of David;</hi> and Divine Wiſdom had ordered, that <hi>of this Man it ſhould be ſaid, He was Born there.</hi>

                  <p>If we look to thoſe Prophecies which were of our Lord's Suffering and Death, they are ſuch as may give us a great deal of ſatisfaction in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour. That of <hi>Eſai</hi> is very expreſs, in Chap. 53. <hi>He is deſpiſed and rejected of Men; a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief. He hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows. He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions; He was bruiſed for our iniquities.</hi> How exactly is his Picture, as it were, drawn by this Prophet? and how pleaſed may we be with <hi>the Likeneſs,</hi> though it <hi>repreſents him</hi> in <hi>Grief and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49802:128"/> Sorrows?</hi> So likewiſe in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9.26. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſixty two Weeks ſhall the Meſſias be cut off, but not for himſelf.</hi> Which things are alſo a good and juſt Interpretation of our Lord's Behaviour under his Sufferings. For ſhould he not have ſuffered <hi>in our ſtead,</hi> but died only as <hi>our Example,</hi> and as <hi>a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Truth of his Doctrine,</hi> (as <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers would have it,) ſome things (I ſpeak it reverently,) would not have born a good Colour; nor at all have been reconcileable to that Perfection which we muſt own to be in our Lord. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one, and that is, <hi>his Sweat in the Garden.</hi> Conſider this without the thoughts of his dying for our Sins, and ſay whether it betrays not <hi>too great a fear of Death;</hi> whether there may not ſeem to have been <hi>greater Inſtances</hi> of <hi>undaunted Courage</hi> from ſome <hi>Heathen Heroes,</hi> and from ſome who have born the Name of Chriſtians, than from Chriſt himſelf. That He ſhould be ſo much <hi>concern'd at a ſingle Death,</hi> when he knew he died for an Example to others <hi>of not fearing Death upon a good occaſion,</hi> what from theſe Mens Opinions can we think of it?</p>
                  <p>But then, when we conſider that <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions;</hi> that he ſtruggled with the Wrath of God which was due to all Men, and was never to have end; that <hi>he trod the Wine-preſs alone,</hi> and <hi>none was with him;</hi> The uncommonneſs of his Sweat (which was as great drops of Blood,) may ſhew forth the greatneſs of the Burthen that was laid upon him; and may make us to wonder at the Power that could at all bear up under ſuch Preſſures; but, by no means, to accuſe him of Timorouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his <hi>Garments</hi> are <hi>thus died with Blood.</hi> So great and reverend is that Action (or Paſſion rather,) of our Lord with reſpect to his Suffering in our ſtead, which otherwiſe will require a good Invention to make it appear not mean.</p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:49802:129"/>
                  <p>Add to this, that Expreſſion of his, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Had he died only for an Example unto us, and a Confirmation of the Truth of what he declared, why ſhould he thus have cried out? Should we ourſelves be called to die for our Holy Religion, I cannot ſay that we might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thus cry unto God: We ought rather to ſubmit unto his Will, with hopes that he had not forſaken us. Somthing elſe then muſt be the cauſe of theſe his words; <hi>viz.</hi> The pouring out of the <hi>full Vials of Gods Wrath</hi> upon Him, as upon one that <hi>bare the Iniquities of us all.</hi> And this will render his words highly appoſite unto, and expreſſive of, his Paſſion, which otherwiſe might ſeem beyond it.</p>
                  <p>So that though we are to conceive of our Lord's Death as an Example unto us, <hi>(for he is ſaid to ſuffer for us, leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps,)</hi> yet as <hi>in his Life</hi> there are ſome things <hi>above an Example,</hi> ſo in <hi>his Death</hi> likewiſe there are, which are placed <hi>beyond our Imitation.</hi> We may imitate his Meekneſs and Patience, and Love to Mankind; but the height of his Sufferings for the Sins of the World we cannot. And ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions betokening the Greatneſs of his Paſſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>his Words</hi> or <hi>Bloody Sweat,</hi> muſt ſtand alone, as highly agreeable to the State of his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but not ſo fit for any beſides Himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus amiable are theſe Prophecies to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Reader; not only in ſo exactly foretelling his Sufferings and Death, and thereby vindicating the Honour of our Religion againſt the Jews who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us with thoſe his Sufferings and Death; but alſo in ſhewing forth a true Beauty in the now-mention'd Deportment of our Saviour, which an horrid Opinion of ſome, who call themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, doth tend to make very unbecoming.</p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:49802:129"/>
                  <p>Nor may the Prophecies of the manner of his Death be leſs ſatisfactory unto us; to wit, <hi>They pierced my Hands and my Feet,</hi> Pſal. 22.17. And Zach. 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced.</hi> For how rightly are theſe fulfilled in his ſuffering the Roman Crucifixion! the Jews having no ſort of Puniſhment, in which the Undergoers were thus pierced. And this Death being inflicted by the Roman Power, directs us to the Satisfaction of another Prophecy; <hi>viz. The Scepter ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Judah till Shiloh come.</hi> But the Power of Life and Death (which is the moſt proper Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Scepter,) being wholly taken from the Jews, and exerciſed in <hi>Judea</hi> by the Romans, may ſhew that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was come <hi>before,</hi> according to that Prophecy. And very remarkable it is, that though <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> before our Lord's Birth, was Conquered by <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, yet throughout the Life of <hi>Hircanus</hi> the High Prieſt, the Reign of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, and <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Son, the Jews did Rule by their own Laws; and ſo, the Scepter was not departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> at the coming of our Lord into the World.</p>
                  <p>I will mention only one Prophecy more, which from <hi>the unexpected Methods,</hi> and the <hi>quick and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Workings of Providence,</hi> may be very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and that is the Prophecy of <hi>Eſai</hi> concerning his Burial, Chap. 53. <hi>He made his Grave with the Rich in his Death.</hi> But how ſhall this be? For the Cuſtom of the Romans required that He and the other Two ſhould continue on the Croſs, expoſed there to the Fowls of the Air to be eaten; or to be conſumed leiſurely by the Air and Weather. That this Prophecy ſhould be fulfilled, God ſo orders it, that the Jews, who were the Authors of his Death, ſhould, though they wiſh'd no good to him, be the Promoters of his Burial. Thus <hi>that the Bodies might
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49802:130"/> not remain on the Croſs upon the Sabbath day,</hi> (which was then a great day,) <hi>the Jews beſought</hi> Pilate <hi>that they might be taken away;</hi> and had their deſire grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But though this were granted them, yet ſtill the Prophecy was in a fair way not to be fulfilled. For among the Jews there <hi>was a place on purpoſe to bury Malefactors in:</hi> And ſo our Lord muſt have been buried with the Thieves; and then <hi>how</hi> could he be ſaid to <hi>make his Grave with the Rich in his Death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That therefore this might be effected, <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> a <hi>Rich Man, and honourable Counſeller,</hi> comes and <hi>begs Chriſt's Body of Pilate. Pilate,</hi> poſſibly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a regard to him as he was a Wealthy Man, and in good eſteem; and not well knowing how to deny the Body of Jeſus to Burial, whom he had declared to be free from fault, though he had afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him; order'd the Body to be given to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi> Who, <hi>after it was wound up in fine Linnen and Spices, laid it in a New Sepulchre, which he, in his Garden, had hewen out of a Rock, for his own Tomb.</hi> And ſo, <hi>contrary to the uſe of the Romans,</hi> he was <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;</hi> and <hi>contrary to the uſe of the Jews,</hi> he was Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not <hi>with Malefactors,</hi> but in a <hi>Creditable Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre with the Rich.</hi> In ſuch an Eminent and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Manner will God bring about his own Counſels; and hath accompliſhed this Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo many other Prophecies directly ſhewing forth the Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and other things relating to our Lord; in which a Religious and Contemplative Soul may find a Rich and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Repaſt. But theſe I at preſent will omit; and will only take notice of what I hinted before, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome other parts of Holy Writ, in themſelves very delightful, do yet afford us a further Delight, and are in a ſort Prophetical, by including the Image of greater things to come. Such were the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49802:130"/> 
                     <hi>Iſraelites coming out</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which ſignified our Lords Coming out from thence. <hi>The Rock</hi> in the Wilderneſs pouring out Water; which Rock was Chriſt. <hi>Jonas</hi>'s being three Days and three Nights in the Whales Belly, and afterwards thrown up; which imported our Lords being ſo long in the Grave, and then Riſing. <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Living, after <hi>Abraham</hi> had in intention Sacrificed him; which betokened our Lords Reſurrection. <hi>Agar and Sarah,</hi> which were an Allegory of the Two Covenants. <hi>Canaan, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> which were Types of a Country, City, and Church above. And many more ſuch as Theſe; which, what a true and ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure do they give to one whoſe Heart is fixed on Sacred things?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>While we look from hence, <hi>backwards,</hi> it may indeed hugely delight us to ſee the <hi>Shadows</hi> of our <hi>future Happineſs.</hi> While from thence we look <hi>forwards,</hi> it may take us wholly up in Love and Joy to behold thoſe Shadows reduced into <hi>Realities;</hi> which for the Excellence in themſelves, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite advantage they give unto us, have been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthy of ſuch Preſignifications.</p>
                  <p>And truly, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> of quite another Strain were thoſe ſpeeches which the Heathen Oracles, gave when they were conſulted about things to come. The Ambiguous Signification of their Words denoted <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> and <hi>Cunning</hi> rather than <hi>Preſcience.</hi> And hence, it is no wonder that they were not forward of themſelves to Propheſie, ſince when ſought unto for knowledge of future Events, they were thus put to their Shifts. For the Devil can <hi>but gueſs</hi> what will be, by comparing preſent affairs with what are paſt. And though <hi>his</hi> gueſſes may more encline to certainty than the gueſſes of <hi>Men,</hi> (for we may ſuppoſe him to have a far greater inſight into former years, and the ſucceſſes of things in them, than any Man can
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49802:131"/> have,) yet, for his Reputation Sake with his Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he durſt not ſpeak things poſitively, but always in a dubious Senſe; that if they fell out otherwiſe than was at firſt thought, another Latent meaning might rather make Men blame their own <hi>Dimſighted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> towards the <hi>Oracle,</hi> than the <hi>Oracle's</hi> towards the <hi>futurities</hi> enquired after.</p>
                  <p>There are, I muſt confeſs, very perſpicuous and important Prophecies in the Books of the Sybils. And I will not ſay, but God in his Goodneſs might inſpire thoſe <hi>Women</hi> for the giving out ſome Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which, as rightly ſuting with the Revelations of the Goſpel, might afterwards the more ſway with the Nations. But many of theſe Prophecies were, by the Pious Fraud of ſome Perſons, not Written till after things were come to paſs: With a deſign, no doubt, to bring a greater honour to what in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was ſo plainly foretold. Thus the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which were aſcribed to the <hi>Cumean Sibyl,</hi> were, in great meaſure, written by the Jews, before our Saviour came into the World. Thoſe which are Extant under the Name of <hi>the Erythrean Sibyl,</hi> are, for the moſt part ſpurious, as being Written by ſome that lived more than an Hundred Years after our Lord. But inſtead of greater, there is leſs credit (as in ſuch dealing it uſually falls out,) both to the Jewiſh and Chriſtian affairs mention'd by them. <hi>Varro,</hi> ſo far as there are Acroſticks in them, denies their Truth. <hi>Cicero,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, contends that they were rather from Human Study, than Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration. And <hi>Celſus</hi> will have many things to be foiſted in by the Chriſtians: So that the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the whole is hereby much diminiſhed. And, indeed, it is, with a rational Man, a very great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt them, that many Oracles there are ſo particular, and direct, that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves are, in ſome things, leſs particular
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49802:131"/> and direct. And who can think that God would more plainly reveal himſelf to <hi>uncouth Women</hi> among the Nations, than to <hi>Holy Men</hi> among his own People; to whom as a Pledge of his Favour, above all others, the Sacred Oracles (as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,) were committed?</p>

                  <p>You do the Prophecies of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no more than right, while you prefer them above all others. There is no Deceit in them. The Time in which they were written is well known: And was long before the things Propheſied came to paſs. The Jews, who were the greateſt Enemies to our Lord, cannot deny the Truth of them. And ſome of theſe Enemies, from the expreſſneſs of thoſe Prophecies which reſpect our Saviours ſufferings, have been forced to ſay, that there is to be a <hi>Suffering Meſſias,</hi> as well as a <hi>Glorious one;</hi> though they will not allow the True Meſſias, who is both the One and the Other, to be either.</p>

                  <p>I could deſire to be continually fixed on the thoughts of the Prophetick part of Scripture; ſo divinely pleaſant is it from the lively Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of great and ſacred things in after-times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. I doubt not, but there will be a true Beauty in that other part of holy Scripture, which you term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>ADHORTATIVE.</hi>

                  <p>If great Love, intermingled with great Art in the enforcing of it, can give a Beauty, (and what can give a greater Beauty than theſe?) it is truly amiable.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed, God, who <hi>knoweth our Frame and Make,</hi> and can tell what Words will moſt Sway the Affections of Men, hath ſeemed to let go none that may prevail with them to be ſuch as they ought to be. Somtimes enforcing his Exhortations, from the Greatneſs of his Favours; the Excellences of his Laws; the Natural Deſires and Averſations of Men; their Forgetfulneſs; and ſuch like.</p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:49802:132"/>
                  <p>I almoſt wonder how any of the Jews of Old, could be Diſobedient, when they read ſuch Words as theſe. <hi>Ask now of the Days that are paſt, ſince the Day that God Created Man upon the Earth; and ask from the One ſide of Heaven unto the Other, whether there hath been any ſuch thing as this great thing is; or hath been heard like it. Did ever People hear the Voice of God ſpeaking out of the mid'ſt of the Fire, as Thou haſt heard, and Live? Or hath God aſſayed to go, and take him a Nation from the midſt of another Nation, by Signs and Wonders, and a Mighty Hand? Thou ſhalt therefore keep his Statutes. He led thee through the great and terrible Wilderneſs, where there was no Water; and he brought thee forth Water out of the Rock of Flint. He fed thee there with Manna, which thy Fathers knew not; Thy Raiment waxed not Old upon thee; neither did thy Foot ſwell theſe Forty years; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhalt thou keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God.</hi> And where an Exhortation is ſet home by the recounting of ſuch mighty Favours, it cannot, ſure but prevail.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing uſually will take more with a Man, than the Reputation of being <hi>Wiſe and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> The Excellency of Man conſiſting in nothing more, than in a Power of Diſcerning and Acting what is good. On this ground therefore it is that God builds his Exhortation: <hi>Keep,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and do theſe Statutes and Judgments, for this is your Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the ſight of the Nations,</hi> Deut. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.6. And, ſince a Man will bear any thing better than the <hi>Name of Fool,</hi> and accounteth it a great Diſcredit to act weakly and below a Man; Therefore God ſo often in Scripture termeth Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience <hi>Folly;</hi> and ſpeaketh thus to Tranſgreſſors; <hi>O ye Fools, when will you learn Wiſdom? How long ye ſimple Ones will ye love Simplicity, and Fools hate Knowledge? Turn you at my Reproof.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>I look upon Peace and Plenty to be, as it were, a <hi>viſible Exhortation,</hi> and a Perſuaſive that is palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and may be felt: But becauſe theſe do ſomtimes ſteal away the Heart, and are apt to render the Man forgetful of his Gracious Benefactor, God, in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs, is pleaſed to ſtrengthen this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by Cautioning us, <hi>when we have eaten and are full, not to forget Him; to take heed to ourſelves; and to keep our Souls diligently, leſt we forget the things which our Eyes have ſeen; and leſt we depart from the Lord our God, all the days of our Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſhould any be ſo heedleſs or perverſe as not to be prevail'd upon by ſuch Exhortations as theſe, how can they hold out againſt God's pathetical Pleading with them? Thus <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18, <hi>Ye ſay, The Way of the Lord is not equal: O Houſe of Iſrael, is not my Way equal? are not your Ways unequal? If ye offer the Lame and the Sick, is it not evil? Offer it now unto thy Governour, will He be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy Perſon? ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. A Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Maſter: If I then be a Father, where is mine Honour? If a Maſter, where is my Fear?</hi> Malac. 1. <hi>I will plead with you, ſaith the Lord, and with your Childrens Children will I plead: For paſs over the Iſles of</hi> Chittim <hi>and ſee, and ſend unto</hi> Kedar, <hi>and conſider diligently, and ſee if there be any ſuch thing. Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods? But my People have changed their Glory for that which profiteth not. Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens, at this, and be horribly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. For my People have committed two Evils; They have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, the Fountain of Living Waters; and hewed them out Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns, that can hold no Water,</hi> Jer. 2.</p>

Yea, the Stork in the Heavens knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow obſerve the time of their coming; but my People know not the Judgment of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 8.

                  <p>There are innumerable other Schemes of Speech, which God Almighty uſeth; as if he would not omit ſo much as one Figure or Topick of ſacred Oratory, by which the wicked Hearts of Men might be bent to their good. And truly all the gracious Methods, which under the Legal Diſpenſation he hath choſen for Perſuaſives, are in force now under the Goſpel, for the engaging us to Obedience; it being through the Blood of Chriſt that ſo much Care and Love was then ſhewed. Only what were made <hi>Excitements</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> are now, with the change of ſome Circumſtances, enlarged, and do belong to the <hi>whole World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for thoſe Exhortations which are more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprized in the Goſpel; what may we ſay of them? or rather what may we not? The <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> is ſo wholly in itſelf a Perſuaſive, ſet off with the higheſt Expreſſions of Divine Wiſdom and Love; that where <hi>IT</hi> alone will not prevail, all other Arguments may ſeem fruitleſs. But that there may nothing be wanting which may work upon the Soul of Man, what affectionate Beſeechings are there added! What earneſt Invitations given!
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49802:133"/> How are pure Minds ſtirred up by way of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance! What fervent Prayers are made for Mens Conſtancy and Perſeverance! What Chriſtian Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row expreſſed at the Defection of any! What ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-heartedneſs ſhewed towards thoſe, who, after a Fall, are repentant! And in them all, what Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives are there for our Love!</p>
                  <p>I have ſomtimes thought, that ſhould a Perſon, to whom the True God is unknown, read, or hear, the earneſt Exhortations, the many taking Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, which in Holy Scripture are uſed for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Men to Obedience, he would judge, that, ſurely, God is much advantaged thereby; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would not be ſo very deſirous of it. This I am ſure we may with Truth ſay; that were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our Obedience could add to the Bleſſedneſs of the Almighty, he could not uſe more winning Speeches for the obtaining of it than now he doth. But therefore becauſe we can no way profit Him by the Obſervance of his Laws, and becauſe it is our own very great advantage if we do obſerve them; how ſweetly prevalent may ſo many perſuaſives ſeem unto us! And how with an holy Gratitude may we ſay; <hi>Lord, what is Man that thou haſt ſuch regard unto him!</hi> That <hi>thou giveſt him Line upon Line,</hi> Exhortation upon Exhortation; and continueſt an unceſſant care over him for the ſecuring him unto Happineſs!</p>

                  <p>It is fit indeed that ſuch Exhortations ſhould be followed with Devotions: <hi>Praiſes</hi> unto God, who is ſo Gracious unto Men; and <hi>Prayers</hi> that we may never ſuffer ſuch perſuaſives to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon us.

                  <p>This we ſhall find to be truly excellent alſo: For it conſiſted of ſuch Services, as (in their intent,) were fit for Men to pay unto their God. None of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49802:134"/> their Holy Feaſts was there, but was in Memory of ſome Signal Favour. And, as it was <hi>their</hi> pleaſure to rejoyce thus before their Lord, and Holy Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, ſo it may likewiſe be <hi>our</hi> pleaſure to read of their Religious doing it. Had the Creation of the World been underſtood by the Heathens, <hi>Juvenal</hi> would not have derided the Jews as ſuch, <hi>Queîs Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima quaeque fuit Lux Ignava; &amp; vitae partem non at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigit ullam: Who loſt the Seventh part of their Time; and improved it to no End of Life.</hi> And if <hi>Plutarch</hi> had known the deſign of their <hi>carrying Boughs of Trees</hi> in their Feaſt of Tabernacles, he would not in a Scoffing Manner have called it the Jewiſh <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by an Odious comparing it with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Feaſt of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> in which the <hi>Bacchides</hi> ran about with Javelins wrapped round with Ivy, term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Their Sacrifices were Viſible Prayers or Praiſes, or Expiations; in all of them the End was truly Excellent; and no one of them had ſuch Rites as required Secreſie, for a Shelter from an honeſt and Chaſt Eye. And hence poſſibly it was, that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Groves to be near his Altar; as having, by their Shades and Receſſes, given occaſion to thoſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes which too frequently attended the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Heathens. Neither ever did or durſt any, <hi>tacita libare acerra; &amp; inaperto vivere voto; ask thoſe things which it were a ſhame Men ſhould hear.</hi> But the Scope of their Petitions was <hi>Gods</hi> Bleſſing in the <hi>way of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as in theſe things their Religious Services were quite of a different Colour from thoſe of the Nations; and in every thing might have worn <hi>this</hi> Impreſs, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> ſo it is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, what Humility and Submiſſion of Spirit, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Devotions when God laid Afflictions upon them. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what pleaſeth him;</hi> ſaith <hi>Eli. I was Dumb, I opened not my Mouth,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49802:134"/> becauſe Thou didſt it;</hi> ſaith <hi>David. Though he kill yet will I put my Truſt in Him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> Herein, likewiſe, very different from the Heathen; who in their Sufferings were forward to <hi>accuſe</hi> their Gods; venting their Griefs in <hi>undecent Invectives</hi> againſt them.</p>
                  <p>But when we read of thoſe ſacred Heights of Devotion which ſome of their Holy Men roſe unto, how muſt we be affected! how divided betwixt Love and Delight! Our Souls are <hi>embruted,</hi> if we be not almoſt transformed into the ſame Seraphick Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with them; who (to uſe the words of one of them) <hi>have thought One day in Gods Courts better than a Thouſand: Deſiring nothing in Heaven but God; nor any thing on Earth in Compariſon of Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſuch Devotion how yet further is it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by our Bleſſed Lord, who hath <hi>continued all Night therein;</hi> who hath Conſecrated himſelf by Prayer a Sacrifice for the whole World; and hath offered up, upon his Croſs, <hi>Supplications with ſtrong Cries and Tears, hoth for Himſelf and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s!</hi> Who is it can avoid the being wholly poſſeſt with Love, who contemplateth our Saviour at the Right Hand of God, in a <hi>mighty way</hi> Mediating for us? Though at a diſtance from us, yet <hi>openly</hi> on our behalf, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Merits, Paſſion and Death, and preſenting our Prayers unto his Father! Which, that they may be the more acceptable, he himſelf, while on Earth, hath given us a moſt perfect Prayer, as a Patte n for our Imitation, and a Form for our Uſe; ſuitable to the greateſt Ardour of Piety that Mortality is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: Hath ſent likewiſe from Heaven the <hi>Holy Spirit to make Interceſſions for us, with Groans that cannot be uttered;</hi> joyning with us from <hi>within,</hi> and giving our Prayers ſuch a Fervour and Powerfulneſs as is not to be equall'd by Words. Devotion raiſed to ſuch Perfection, as the having our Bleſſed Lord,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49802:135"/> and the Holy Spirit ſo nearly concerned in it, is ſo highly amiable, that it requires only the being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, for the being ſincerely loved.</p>
                  <p>You have, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> in ſhort meaſures, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Divine Law, as the word <hi>Law</hi> may be taken in the <hi>wider ſenſe.</hi>

                  <p>How acceptable the account you have given me is, I cannot more truly ſay, than by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you I could have very willingly heard it much longer. Yea, ſo delightful are theſe other parts of Holy Writ, that they afford a great pleaſure even to ſome, who are leſs Obſervers of the <hi>Preceptive Part</hi> than they ought to be. I have known who have been very well verſed in the Bible, and could reherſe, if need were, the chief things contain'd therein, when yet their Practice hath been as lame as if they knew not a Letter there.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Perſons quite miſtake what they read, while they find a Pleaſure therein, without a reſpect to the Divine Law properly as ſuch. All the other parts of Scripture are, (as before was ſaid,) ſome way or other, in order to the Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Part; and if there be who underſtand them otherwiſe, they go contrary to the Mind and Will of their Author.</p>
                  <p>But yet, how can any one enjoy a Pleaſure from that Hiſtory, which God hath cauſed to be written as an <hi>Encouragement</hi> to Obedience, and not be <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged</hi> at the ſame time to be <hi>Obedient</hi> himſelf? Or how acknowledge the <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> in the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſobedience, and not be prompted to <hi>fear</hi> Him, who is Righteous in his Judgments, and will not ſpare the Wicked? If God be <hi>True</hi> in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> who will not think him ſo in his <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings?</hi> And ſhall ſo many <hi>Prophecies</hi> concerning <hi>Him who came to deſtroy the Works of the Devil,</hi> give any delight to him who is reſolved to retain thoſe
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49802:135"/> Works? It would be a ſtrange Contradiction, that any one ſhould be pleaſed with the <hi>Winning Exhortations</hi> which God uſeth to engage Men unto the Obſervance of his Laws, and yet, in the mean while, be unconcerned whether he obſerve thoſe Laws or not. And how can the <hi>Devotion</hi> of the Saints of old touch his Soul with any delight, who is, and is reſolved to continue, a Stranger unto what he readeth them to have been remarkable for; and who neglecteth that Obedience, without which their Prayers and Praiſes would not have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God? Whoſoever they be, that, with no Conformity to the Divine Law, are yet pleaſed with, and do pretend to love, the holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, they ſhall be rewardable in the ſight of God no more than one that loveth the Writings of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> or <hi>Livy.</hi> It is not from a Principle of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that theſe Authors are delighted in; but they pleaſe the Fancy, and yield ſomthing that hits the Readers Humour. Juſt ſo is it with this Divine Book in reſpect of theſe Men. They like it not for the great Deſign it hath; but they find ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, from its great variety, that delights the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative Faculty: Or their Knowledge therein is in Queſt of Opinion and Reputation among Men: Which, how much below the Dignity of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Volume is it! Opinion and Reputation, even in Obedience, will ſtand a Man in little ſtead here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; much leſs will they, when they are without Obedience.</p>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>The Divine Laws are indeed worthy the higheſt pitch of our Affections; and they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Men who find a more quick and grateful Reliſh from them, than from all Earthly Objects. Yet I cannot ſay, but there may be a true love of them, when it is otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>For our Paſſions have a very great dependence upon the outward Senſes: And theſe Senſes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſtrong impreſſions from Material things, and from them alone, no wonder that the Soul is viſibly affected; and this ſomtimes the more, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedneſs, and pleaſing ſurprize with which theſe External Objects preſent themſelves; inſomuch that it requires Labour and Pains to keep our Affections within due Bounds.</p>
                  <p>But the Caſe is different with the Divine Laws; they, being of a Spiritual Nature; and in many things above the outward Senſe, do not make thoſe impreſſions thereupon, which Viſible Objects do. So that here, if the Affections be ſtirr'd, they muſt be ſo, not immediately from the <hi>Things,</hi> but from the <hi>Souls own Reaſoning,</hi> and deliberate Thoughts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating theſe Laws, and the great advantages which they give. Add to this, that <hi>things future</hi> (for ſuch the Reward of theſe Laws are,) do not give ſo <hi>quick a Senſe,</hi> as thoſe that are <hi>preſent.</hi> And becauſe the Soul is at <hi>ſome pains</hi> in thinking; and the things thought of are of <hi>old ſtanding</hi> to our knowledge, (as the Practicks of Religion uſually are,) there is not that pleaſure from <hi>ſurprize,</hi> as in thoſe things that fall out <hi>unthought of,</hi> or are <hi>new</hi> unto us.</p>
                  <p>A Perſon that is truly Obedient to theſe Laws, and reſolves to continue ſo, need not deſpond, as if his Love to them were unſincere, though he finds not his Affections raiſed to ſuch a pleaſurable Senſe, as he conceiveth ſomtimes from Worldly things.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49802:136"/> God will not require that things ſhould act upon the Soul, otherwiſe than is their Nature to do: And if his Laws <hi>obtain their</hi> End, by producing Righteouſneſs of Life, there is a <hi>better Evidence</hi> of Love to them, than from <hi>inward delight alone</hi> there would be. Yea, poſſibly, if the Man will ceaſe diſquieting himſelf, and will calmly ſearch his own Heart, he will diſcern that the Sacred Laws are very much approved of there; and eſteemed far beyond thoſe Earthly Objects which ſo highly delighted him. He ſees that the <hi>Affections</hi> which theſe outward things did ſo much <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>raiſe,</hi> do, after a little while, <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>ſink again.</hi> But the Divine Law finds a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued reſpect</hi> within him. And though the Love thereof do not <hi>enkindle a flame in Him,</hi> yet it ceaſeth not to have <hi>Warmth in itſelf.</hi> He ſees that his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not always in his <hi>own power</hi> to raiſe them as he pleaſeth: He will therefore endeavour that his <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhall ſupply their Defects: And that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Precepts ſhall never want <hi>This</hi> to attend them, if he cannot yield them the <hi>Other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe that there be a great <hi>Coldneſs</hi> towards theſe Laws, and an <hi>inward indiſpoſition</hi> to Obedience; yet if notwithſtanding he will <hi>reſolutely Obey;</hi> and, what he cannot do with that <hi>pleaſure</hi> which ſome others have, will do <hi>through pains and ſtriving,</hi> he will not be diſapproved by his Lord. <hi>An ill Temper of Soul or Body</hi> is one of thoſe <hi>Enemies</hi> againſt which he is to <hi>Exerciſe</hi> a <hi>Spiritual Valour.</hi> And if he ſhall Fight and Conquer, (and Conquer he doth if his Obedience be ſtill on the upper hand,) he ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have a Crown. And, for ought I know, it will be as weighty an One, as his, who obeyeth theſe Laws with leſs Difficulty. <hi>This Man,</hi> indeed, is much happier in <hi>the way,</hi> but <hi>the other</hi> ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as happy in <hi>the End.</hi>

                  <p>What you have ſaid I believe would be much for the quiet of the Perſons we ſpake of: Who, by more ſuſpecting their Obedience for its ſeeming Coldneſs, than approving it for its real ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, do want ſuch Lenitives.</p>

                  <p>I ſhould be glad, could I Adminiſter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to any who are truly Religious. Though, to ſay Truth, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> many are too apt to make an ill uſe of what is ſpoken after this manner: And do improve it, not ſo much to a right appeaſing of their ſadder thoughts, as to the reconciling themſelves to a careleſs or hardned Temper of Soul. I would therefore urge what would certainly be for the good of all; <hi>viz. S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH A FREQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ENCY AND FIX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EDNESS OF THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHTS</hi> upon the Divine Laws, as the Royal Pſalmiſt expreſſeth; who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he had ſaid, <hi>O how I Love thy Law,</hi> addeth, <hi>It is my Meditation all the Day.</hi> By which we may conceive that the Sacred Variety, and the Wondrous things of Holy Writ, did find that Conſtancy of Entertainment in his Heart which was worthy of them.</p>
                  <p>And where, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> is there ſuch ſatisfaction to be met with, as the Sacred Scriptures reach out unto us! And how little may other things, and how wholly may Theſe, engage our Thoughts! The being Happy, you know, is that which every one looketh after. To this all Mens Aims and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are bent; though in Paths much different one from another; and, for the moſt part, at the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſtance from what is ſought. And well may they be ſo, ſince none of them reach beyond the Grave.</p>
                  <p>Not to mention thoſe things which are of a groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Nature, relating to the Body; and which Men vigourouſly contend for, riſing early and ſitting up late; view let us, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> thoſe things which the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49802:137"/> more <hi>thinking ſort</hi> of Men do perſue. Books and Learning I would not be thought to plead againſt; you know I very much eſteem and honour them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what is it generally, that Men employ their Thoughts and Studies about? Are they not better skill'd in one anothers Ignorance and Errors than in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Truth of things? And thoſe Truths which with great pains and long ſearches they find out, how mean are they if throughly conſider'd? They ſatisfie not the Man when he comes to Dye; who would have ſomthing elſe than ſome Truth in Hiſtory, or ſome Demonſtration in Mathematicks, or ſome Rules of Policy to cheer him; for they will ſtand him in no ſtead then. Nay, even thoſe parts of Philoſophy, which tend chiefly to the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the <hi>Fears of Death,</hi> how cold and inſipid are they? The beſt that any of the Heathen Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have ſpoken amounts only to this, That the Souls ſurviving the Body was, at the moſt, but an Opinion; and a thing which ſome of them rather wiſh'd <hi>ſhould</hi> be, than were ſure that <hi>it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſaepe emori, ſi fieri poſſet, vellem, ut ea quae dicam liceret invenire. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trum autem ſit melius vivere an mori Dii immortales ſciunt, Hominum quidem ſcire arbitror neminem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> (in <hi>Cic.</hi>) one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pleaders for the Souls Immortality. <q>I would, were it poſſible for me, often die, if ſo I might at laſt find the things I ſpeak of: But whether it be better to live or die, God alone knoweth; I ſuppoſe no Man living can tell.</q> Small Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth this give to a Man, who, to his earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of having his Being continued, hath, at the higheſt, ſuch mean grounds for his hope.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth he find himſelf any more at eaſe from its being ſaid, <hi>That the Man who is dead, in his having ceaſed to be, is altogether devoid of Miſery.</hi> For if he perceiveth no Miſery, he is altogether as far from
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49802:138"/> perceiving any thing of Pleaſure. And ſurely the falling from a place amongſt Men, into a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no better than that of a Stone, or any other ſenſeleſs thing, may encline him, who conſiders it, unto penſiveneſs and ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>And doth it make any jot more for his content to be told, <hi>That he ſhall go the ſame way that all Men before him have gone, and that all after him ſhall go?</hi> Certainly it doth not. For may it not rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Complaints, in that not only all Men thus die, but are alſo denied that length of Life which is granted to many other Creatures inferiour unto Men? Fain would he when he comes to lie on his Death-Bed, not wholly periſh. Earneſtly he deſires that his Soul may yet further live, and find elſewhere that Happineſs which in this World he ſought in vain. And, might it be, he would wiſh that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which he hath taken ſo much care of, and which hath been inſtrumental to thoſe Actions that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended both to God and Men, ſhould not have an utter end in the Grave.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe things are by our Lawgiver affixed as Rewards to the Obedience of his Laws: Rewards, though vaſtly great, yet not greater than the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of thoſe Laws are, which, and only which, through God's Mercy, can make the Man fit for ſo boundleſs an Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>Life and Immortality are brought to Light,</hi> and are, as wiſh'd for by Men, ſo, throughly made known unto them; in ſo much that they have not the Liberty now of <hi>thinking either way,</hi> but are in Duty to believe theſe things ſo to be, as being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by ſuch Arguments, than which in Modeſty and Reaſon greater cannot be deſired, how ſhould they with earneſtneſs be thought of? And how the Laws, betwixt which and them there is ſo cloſe a Connexion, be, with a more than ordinary intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49802:138"/> contemplated? Surely it is but meet it thus ſhould be, ſince a Mans chief Welfare deſerves his ſetled and conſtant Thoughts; and ſince, through the infinite Mercy of our Lord to us in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of thoſe his Laws, the leaſt and moſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of our Being, and Happineſs, is in this World; and that which ſhall be in the next, is, in Compariſon of it, no leſs than a whole Ocean to a ſingle Drop.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch Meditation, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> we the rather may exerciſe, not only becauſe, if we did not know theſe things to be true, nothing could be more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by us than that they ſhould be true; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being, even while Children, inſtructed in them, and never remembring the time that we were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of them, we are apt thereupon to be the leſs affected with their Greatneſs and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It is pity that the ſenſe of theſe mighty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould loſe any thing of its quickneſs, by our long acquaintance with them; which ought rather to heighten our eſteem of, and thankfulneſs for, them. A very great Imperfection in our Nature this is, but may in good meaſure be cured; and no better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod can we uſe for the doing it, than frequent and devout Contemplations, which will bring us to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and give us a lively reliſh of the things which belong to our Everlaſting Peace.</p>

                  <p>They doubtleſs will be of very great avail.

But then to difference them from Men, and to ſet them in a lower Rank, they have
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49802:139"/> allow'd to none but Men ſuch a Rational Nature as is capable of Religion; and ſuch a Faculty of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as can conceive what Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and the higher ſort of Truths are. And therefore, ſince Men alone, of all Earthly Beings, are endued with this Faculty, we cannot but think that it is to be laid out, and not loſt by neglect.</p>

And whatſoever Diſcompoſure his Mind hath ſuffered by them, he hereby rectifies, and ſets all ſtrait again. He can, in This, behold, as at a diſtance, the Irregularities of others; and ſolace himſelf that he is out of the reach of bad Example. And though a true reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Covetouſneſs, Pride, Ambition, and ſuch like Evils, which prevail ſo much abroad; and on the Troubles, which they betray thoſe unto whoſe Vices they are, and ſomtimes thoſe whoſe Vices they are not, doth raiſe ſome concernedneſs and grief within him; yet he perceives a ſatisfaction not altogether unlike unto his, who ſeeing others toſs'd on troubled Waves is himſelf ſafe at Land: Or who, diſcerning whole Armies engaged in Fight, is ſecure himſelf from the Danger. And not only ſo, but, by ſuch Meditation, he dreſſes and adorns his Soul for an Holy Converſe with God; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly enjoys the Communion of Bleſſed Spirits in things ſo reſined and Heavenly, that no Earthly pleaſure is to be compared with them.</p>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49802:139"/> Us; who have ſo far degenerated from the Saints of Old, that we find much tediouſneſs in that which they placed their greateſt delight, and ſpent moſt of their time, in. When ſome of Them have laid down their Lives amidſt Torments for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we think much to ſpend ſome ſerious Thoughts about the things which relate to our Eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; yea, we look upon it as a Task and Trouble to meditate even upon the infinite Love of God to us; and can hardly do it, though but for a few Minutes, without Wearineſs and Diſtraction.</p>

                  <p>Happy it would be, if Men could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon to Love their own Happineſs, and to place their Thoughts thereon.

                  <p>To ſuch Men as Theſe are, I would urge only <hi>this one thing.</hi> Let them betake themſelves to <hi>frequent and ſerious Conſiderations;</hi> and if upon <hi>due ſearch</hi> into the Holy Scriptures, and an humble and conſtant <hi>repairing unto God by Prayer,</hi> that he would open their Eyes for the diſcerning the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things of his Law, they ſhall repent of their Pains, as being either loſt or not well requited; let them then forſake the Divine Laws, and ſeek elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for Peace and Reſt.</p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:49802:140"/>
                  <p>But if, after ſuch <hi>Search,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Prayers,</hi> any ſhould forſake theſe Laws, might not our Lord ſay unto them as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Hadad,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.22. <hi>What haſt thou lacked with me, that thou ſeekeſt to return into thine own Country?</hi> What is it that you have wanted with me? Could greater Love be ſhew'd you? More Holy and Righteous Laws be given you? Or more deſireable Rewards be held forth unto you? That you ſhould leave me, and return to the World, where you will find nothing but Diſſatisfaction?</p>
                  <p>We may with Truth ſay unto Men, That there are the greateſt Excellences in the Laws of our Lord; and an Happineſs yeilded by them, which no where elſe can be found. But whoever ſhall with Reverence and Singleneſs of Heart look into them, may ſay of them as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.6.7, 8. <hi>It was a true Report that we heard of the great Wiſdom and Goodneſs</hi> that were in theſe Laws. <hi>We believed not until we came, and our Eyes had ſeen it; and behold the half was not told us.

                  <p>DIſobedience is a Pollution. It brings Diſorder into a Man. It tends to make the Almighty to miniſter to his Creatures in the vileſt Offices. How God cannot be made to ſerve, How he may. He is pleas'd in Holy Writ to ſpeak after the manner of Men, that ſo He may condeſcend to our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and excite our Affections. How He is made to ſerve in His Holy Name. How in His Works. The Creation ſenſible of this Slavery, and God very much diſpleas'd with it. Diſobedience of an Extenſive Nature. It affects a kind of Eternity. It's highly Diſingenuous. God neceſſitates none to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. Why He will not force Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Obedience. Why he generally cuts them not off.</p>

But, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Excellency of the Divine Laws, and the great Happineſs that Men have in them, my Thoughts at length run on to the Conſideration of Diſobedience thereunto.

                  <p>INdeed, <hi>Theophilus, Sin, Iniquity,</hi> or <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> (or whatever Name beſides evil Actions have,) all of which are nothing elſe but <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi>) are Character'd in Holy Scriptures by <hi>Pollution</hi> and <hi>Filthineſs.</hi> And as a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of ſuch <hi>Defilement,</hi> were thoſe <hi>Numerous Waſhings</hi> under the Old Law. And thoſe <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which had the Sins of the People confeſſed over them, were, by reaſon of thoſe Sins, ſo <hi>polluted,</hi> that they were <hi>commanded to be burnt out of the Camp;</hi> and they who burnt them there, were by them in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>defiled,</hi> that they could not return into the Camp till they <hi>had waſh'd their Cloaths, and bath'd their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49802:141"/> Fleſh in Water,</hi> Levit. 16.28. And anſwerable hereunto did the Prophets afterwards ſpeak; <hi>Waſh me throughly from mine Iniquity, and cleanſe me from my Sin,</hi> Pſal. 51.2. <hi>They were defiled with their own Works,</hi> Pſal. 106.39. <hi>Though thou waſh thee with Nitre, and take thee much Soap, yet thy Iniquity is mark'd before me; how canſt thou ſay, I am clean?</hi> Jer. 2.23. And upon the account of the Filthineſs of Sin, God is ſaid to be of <hi>purer Eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity,</hi> Hab. 2.13.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſpeak otherwiſe of Diſobedience. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, Falſe-witneſſings, Blaſphemies; theſe are the Things which DEFILE the Man,</hi> Matth. 15.19. And hence the <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to cleanſe us from all Sin.</hi> And Baptiſm is not only a Rite that doth <hi>initiate</hi> us into Chriſtianity, but is termed the <hi>Waſhing of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> as <hi>purifying</hi> us from the <hi>Pollutions of our Natures.</hi> And truly ſo odious and foul is Sin, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> would ſet it off moſt in its own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, he could find no worſe word for it than it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for he calls it <hi>ſinful Sin, Rom.</hi> 7.13.

                  <p>It is even ſo as you ſay, <hi>Theophilus.</hi> But as Diſobedience to the Divine Law throws a Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon every Faculty of the Soul, and Member of the Body; ſo it alſo gives a further Deformity, by bringing a <hi>Diſorder</hi> into the Man; and cauſing that which ſhould be ſuperiour, and have chief command in him, to be brought under, and made to ſerve; His ſenſitive Appetite getting above his Rational, and his Body bearing ſway over his Soul. Neither when ſuch Diſorder is at home, and in his own Breaſt, is it like to ſtay there alone; but, in all probability, it will ſpread itſelf <hi>abroad,</hi> and in the Community: For the <hi>Diſcompoſures,</hi> which are there, ariſe firſt from <hi>private Iregularities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not only doth Diſobedience to the Divine Law overturn all order in the <hi>Man himſelf,</hi> and breed Confuſion in <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> but (what is abundantly worſe,) it induceth a yet <hi>higher Diſorder</hi> into the World; <hi>Subjecting, as it were, the Great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and making him to Miniſter unto his Creatures in the vileſt Offices.</hi> They are his own Words to his Diſobedient People of Iſrael, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.24. <hi>Thou haſt made Me TO SERVE with thy Sins;</hi> And what greater Deformity can there be thought of, than ſuch Diſorder as this, that ſhall reach, not only ſo wide as the <hi>Earth,</hi> but even unto <hi>Heaven?</hi> And who would not hate Diſobedience, which is the Cauſe and Source of it?</p>

                  <p>I can eaſily grant, that, from Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Divine Laws, there ariſeth ſuch <hi>Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſorder,</hi> as you ſpeak of, in <hi>Private Men,</hi> and in <hi>Communities</hi> alſo on Earth.</p>
                  <p>But how can it extend itſelf unto <hi>Heaven,</hi> for the <hi>bringing of God under?</hi> It is his Name, <hi>I am that I am;</hi> which denotes the Immutability of his Being, and ſuch a Perfection, as cannot any way be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. As he is Omnipotent, He cannot be <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd</hi> by any; as He is the All-wiſe God, there is none can <hi>Circumvent</hi> him. As he is perfectly One in his Eſſence, without any the leaſt mixture, He can no way be <hi>ſubject to any Alteration.</hi> And as He is Eternal, He not only can never <hi>ceaſe to Be;</hi> but alſo, he cannot ever be <hi>leſs than infinitely perfect,</hi> and <hi>infinitely Bleſſed:</hi> Which is, altogether inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with <hi>ſerving;</hi> for that ſuppoſeth Weakneſs, and Deficiency.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> ſince I ſee you intend it as the <hi>chiefeſt Brand</hi> on Diſobedience, that it <hi>maketh the Almighty</hi> to <hi>be Inferiour, and Servile,</hi> I deſire you would explain it to me. For the Almighty's ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That by Mens Sins (i. e.</hi> by the Breaches of his Laws,) <hi>he is made to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>e,</hi> is the higheſt <hi>Infamy,</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> to Diſobedience; and may render it <hi>loathſome</hi> to any conſidering Perſon: And ſo, is Worthy to be inſiſted on ſomthing largely by you.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>In reſpect of his <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Perſon, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus,</hi> God cannot, for the reaſon you have given, be made to <hi>ſerve.</hi> Sin we with never ſo high an Hand, we cannot put any reſtraints upon his Nature; and be we never ſo Righteous, we cannot render his Perſon more Bleſſed. And to this Senſe is that of <hi>Job</hi> 35.6. <hi>If thou be Righteous, what giveſt thou Him? Or what receiveth he of thine Hand? If thou Sinneſt, what doſt thou againſt Him?</hi> Break his Laws
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49802:143"/> thou mayſt, and provoke his Juſtice, but thou canſt never render Him <hi>leſs Perfect,</hi> or <hi>leſs Bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then we muſt know, that God is pleas'd in Holy Writ, to ſpeak after the <hi>way and faſhion of Men;</hi> not ſo as is <hi>perfectly agreeing</hi> with his own Nature, but ſo, as is <hi>moſt ſutable</hi> to our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and may moſt prevail with, and move, us.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Eye, Ear, Mouth, Arms, Heart, Feet,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Members</hi> are in Sacred Scripture, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God, not that there are any ſuch, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Him, (for He is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and altogether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal.) But that we might, by theſe Senſible Things, the better conceive thoſe Perfections, which are ſhadow'd out by them. For it is not unworthy of Obſervation, That there are no <hi>Members</hi> nor <hi>Parts</hi> of a Man aſcribed unto God, in Holy Scripture, but what do betoken ſome <hi>Excellence,</hi> or <hi>other in Him;</hi> as his Power, his Wiſdom, his Knowledge, his Love, and ſuch like. And none of thoſe Parts that are (as the Apoſtle terms them,) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>more feeble, leſs honourable,</hi> or <hi>uncomely,</hi> are any where attributed unto Him.</p>
                  <p>The Jews have a Saying <hi>Lumen Supernum nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam deſcendit ſine Indumento; Heavenly Light never deſcends</hi> without ſome Vail. It, otherwiſe, would be too bright for our weak Eyes. So theſe Members of the Body, which God is pleaſed to admit of, when he ſpeaks of Himſelf unto Us, are but as <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> to thoſe Excellencies, which we could not ſo well underſtand, ſhould He have ſpoken ſutably to Himſelf, without any reſpect had unto us.</p>
                  <p>And, as God doth condeſcend to <hi>our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> by ſpeaking unto us after an Human manner, and in a way below Himſelf; ſo in other things He ſpeaks to move, and <hi>excite our Affections;</hi> when yet his Words are not to be thought properly to agree
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49802:143"/> unto him. Thus doth he in a favourable Senſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Concerning the Work of my Hands, Command ye me.</hi> Sovereignty we know Eſſentially belongs unto Him; and He can as ſoon loſe his Being, as He can That: But that He may the more win upon us, He thus expreſſeth Himſelf; as if He had ſaid, you ſhall not find me Lofty towards You: But ſo far condeſcending, as, in your Reaſonable Requeſts, <hi>to ſerve you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus alſo he is ſaid to be <hi>Angry,</hi> to <hi>Repent,</hi> to be <hi>preſſed</hi> with <hi>Mens Sins, as a Cart is preſſed with Sheaves:</hi> Not that there can be in Him any ſuch thing as the Paſſion of Anger, or of Repentance, or of Grief; for then there would be ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and change in God: Which cannot be to the better, becauſe he is infinitely Bleſſed; nor to the Worſe, becauſe then He would loſe of his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſo, no alteration can there be in Him at all; and therefore the expreſſing himſelf thus, in Scripture, is the more to <hi>prevail</hi> with <hi>us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The intent of what I have ſaid is this: To wit,</p>
                  <p>That God may be ſaid, though not properly, yet, after the way of Human Speech, to be made to ſerve by Mens Diſobedience. And thoſe his Words in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> are as much as if he had ſaid; <hi>Thou haſt done, what in thee lies, to make me ſerve by thy Sins.</hi> Which way of Speech is highly moving, by ſhewing, that could he have been brought under, and made to ſerve, they, by their untoward Carriages, had done enough to effect it. Had he been a <hi>Man,</hi> this would have been the <hi>fruit</hi> of his <hi>Favours</hi> to <hi>Them;</hi> this their <hi>Gratitude to Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly, Wicked Men do in a ſort effect, that the moſt High ſhall ſerve them even in his Perſon; by <hi>putting him off from time to time,</hi> and cauſing Him to attend their Leiſure. Thus when <hi>He,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ſtays at the Door and Knocks;</hi> earneſtly
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49802:144"/> calling upon them to turn unto him, that they may Live; they are not yet at <hi>Leiſure;</hi> with <hi>Felix,</hi> they are apt to ſay, <hi>Go thy way, for this time; when we have a Convenient Seaſon we will ſend for Thee.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many years are paſt; or when ſuch buſineſſes are done; or ſuch deſigns accompliſhed; or ſuch Sins acted; then, it may be, they will hearken unto him; and is not this a making him <hi>Serve,</hi> when he muſt thus wait <hi>their Motions;</hi> as if their Wills were Superiour unto his; and <hi>he</hi> were rather to obſerve <hi>Them,</hi> then <hi>They Him?</hi>

                  <p>It is abundantly ſufficient for the ſetting forth the hatefulneſs of Diſobedience, that it tends to invert the Univerſe; and to reduce Him into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, whoſe very Being it is to be Supream of the World.

                  <p>But I think, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that <hi>God's being made to Serve by Mens Sins,</hi> may have a more <hi>proper</hi> Signification, if we conſider Him not as to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> but as to <hi>his Name,</hi> and <hi>Works.</hi> The former (as hath been ſaid,) cannot be more or leſs Glorious than they are; but the later may be <hi>Exalted,</hi> or <hi>Depreſt</hi> among Men; had in <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Vilified</hi> in their Words and Practice.</p>
                  <p>And after this manner, God, in Sacred Writ, is ſaid, to be <hi>magnified,</hi> though in himſelf, he be ſo Great that his Greatneſs can admit of no Addition. <hi>O Magnifie the Lord with me,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt,) that is, as the next Words have it, <hi>Let us exalt his NAME together.</hi> And thus Exalted, and Magnified he may be, by being had in Reverence, <hi>inwardly,</hi>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:49802:144"/> of thoſe who draw near unto Him, and <hi>outwardly,</hi> by being celebrated in a Religious Manner; in the Hearing, and View of Men.</p>
                  <p>Thus, likewiſe may he be <hi>Leſs'ned,</hi> or <hi>brought Lower;</hi> for, while we are call'd upon to Magnifie, and Exalt the Lord, it would be a fruitleſs Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs it were poſſible that God ſhould be thus Undervalued, and Vilified among Men.</p>
                  <p>He is <hi>brought under,</hi> when Men do <hi>uſe his Holy Name</hi> for the promoting thoſe Deſigns which are contrary to his Infinite Purity, and Righteouſneſs. He is alſo made to Serve, when <hi>his Works</hi> are preſt for the carrying on of Evil Actions; contrary to that of <hi>Job</hi> 36.24. where we are bid <hi>to remember that we Magnifie his Works.</hi>

                  <p>As for his <hi>Holy Name, Theophilus,</hi> how do they make the Almighty to Serve <hi>their Turns</hi> only, when they uſe it for the appearing, in ſome Actions, to be <hi>Religious;</hi> not that they may bring any true Glory unto God, but that they may advance their <hi>Secular Intereſt,</hi> or their <hi>Reputation,</hi> among Men? Or yet worſe, when they ſhall <hi>pretend</hi> Piety, for the more ſecure <hi>acting of Wickedneſs;</hi> abuſing the Holy One <hi>into a Miſt,</hi> as it were, which they'l throw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mens Eyes, that they may not be diſcerned in their ſhameful Deeds?</p>
                  <p>And the ſame thing do they, when, for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own unjuſt Cauſe, they ſhall procure others <hi>to Swear</hi> that which is not ſo; or when they ſhall lend their <hi>own falſe Oaths</hi> for the advantage of their Friend, or the Damage of their Enemy.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49802:145"/> as to the Thing they are charged with; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, it will not be unto them according as they have Curſed.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, <hi>The frequent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurping of Gods Sacred Name,</hi> upon almoſt every trivial occaſion, to <hi>Vows or Oaths,</hi> or to a <hi>Vain ſwaggering,</hi> and the <hi>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Credit</hi> of not appearing to be <hi>ſtrict and religious.</hi> When that <hi>Great Name,</hi> the Reputation of which God ſtands ſo much up for, and which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Argument in our Exigences, for our prevailing with Him for Aid, <hi>(What wilt thou do to thy Great Name?)</hi> when that, which ſhould eſtabliſh all Truth in the World, is hal'd to the confirming the quite contrary: When that, at which the Devil trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſhall be forced for the carrying on of his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Service, do they not bring the Great and Holy God into the worſt of Slaveries, into that which his Soul doth perfectly loath?</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49802:145"/> ways of reducing it, upon all occaſions, into practice.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Will,</hi> which ought to be bent to the pleaſing of God, in an Univerſal Compliance with his Laws, ſhall be forward in the deſiring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of Evil, and ſhall reſt ſatisfied in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Memory,</hi> which is ſo well fitted for God's Service, ſhall be far from retaining the great Mercies he hath ſhewed to Men in general, and to ourſelves in particular, in various Circumſtances of our Lives. When the excellent Things of God's Law are allow'd no room in it; but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when itſelf is chiefly imploy'd in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of thoſe things which are light, and vain; in the preſerving preſent to our Minds the readieſt ways of bringing about ill Actions; and in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh thoſe Injuries which by others have been done us, whether through Imprudence, Paſſion, or Deſign; that we may never, upon Opportunities, forget to revenge them.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Affections,</hi> which ſhould be engaged in an <hi>Holy Joy</hi> at the great things which God hath done for us; in an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfeigned Love</hi> to Him for his being ſo loving and gracious unto us; in a <hi>Delight</hi> in thoſe Commandments, which are ſo agreeable to the Nature and Souls of Men; in an <hi>Ardent Longing</hi> for that Bleſſed State, where we ſhall be wholly freed from Sin: When <hi>theſe Affections,</hi> I ſay, ſhall be turned into <hi>Coldneſs</hi> towards God and the Things of Heaven; into an <hi>hot and eager perſuit</hi> after thoſe things which miniſter only to Worldly Advantage, or Senſual Pleaſures; into <hi>Ill Wiſhes</hi> towards others, <hi>Envy</hi> at their Welfare, <hi>Delight</hi> in their Troubles or Miſcarriages.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe, when our <hi>Bodies,</hi> which are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall be alienated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49802:146"/> Uſes; when our <hi>Members,</hi> which are the <hi>Members of Chriſt,</hi> ſhall be made to <hi>become the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs;</hi> our <hi>Eyes</hi> in beholding Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, our <hi>Tongues</hi> in uttering Deceit, or thoſe things which <hi>Miniſter not Grace to the Hearers;</hi> our <hi>Hands</hi> in doing that which is Evil; our <hi>Feet</hi> in being ſwift in running to Miſchief; all of which were made for better Ends.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Men,</hi> which were Created in the <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God,</hi> and ſhould, in their Actions alſo, be <hi>like him,</hi> ſhall through Diſobedience have their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> brought under <hi>to ſuch vile Offices,</hi> is not the Great God made <hi>to ſerve</hi> in the <hi>Principal of his Handy-Works</hi> on Earth? Certainly he is.</p>
                  <p>We know, among Men, there may be a ſuffering of Indignities <hi>in Effigie;</hi> in ſomthing that ſhall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent</hi> the Man, though his <hi>Perſon</hi> be <hi>abſent</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched;</hi> and the Diſcredit ſhall redound to him, in great meaſure, as if he himſelf had in Perſon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And will it be otherwiſe with the Almighty God? We are his <hi>Image and Likeneſs,</hi> in reſpect of our <hi>Souls;</hi> and <hi>both in our Souls and Bodies,</hi> we bear the <hi>Image of his Son our Lord,</hi> who was pleaſed to take upon him our <hi>whole Nature.</hi> If therefore Diſobedience ſhall throw ſuch Diſhonour on his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and Workmanſhip in us, although it reach not his <hi>Perſon</hi> to hurt that, it yet makes him, through his <hi>Works</hi> and his <hi>Image</hi> too, (as we are his Works and Image,) to <hi>ſerve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doth it, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> any more <hi>ſpare</hi> the Almighty, in the <hi>other viſible things of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sun, and Moon, and Stars, in their Light and Influences; The Earth, and Sea, and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thereof in their ſeveral Capacities, He made inſtrumental to the Life, and Virtuous Actions of Men; and, through them, to his own Praiſe and Glory. And therefore ſince They (as of themſelves
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49802:146"/> being <hi>Mute,</hi>) cannot <hi>Celebrate</hi> the <hi>Praiſes</hi> of their Creator, <hi>Man's Mouth</hi> is to be <hi>theirs,</hi> and to <hi>offer</hi> up Praiſe unto God in their ſtead. Thus did the Royal Pſalmiſt for them; <hi>Praiſe the Lord, ye Sun and Moon: Praiſe him all the Stars of Light. Praiſe the Lord, ye Heavens, and ye Waters that be above the Heavens. Praiſe the Lord from the Earth, ye Deeps; Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapours, Wind and Storm, fulfilling his Word. Mountains and all Hills; Fruitful Trees and all Cedars; Beaſts and all Cattel; Creeping things and Flying Fowl,</hi> Pſal. 148.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe, ſince theſe <hi>Viſible Things,</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>are unable</hi> to do any <hi>Virtuous Deeds</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto Men, our <hi>Hands</hi> are, in ſome ſort, to become <hi>theirs,</hi> through which they are to promote Actions of Juſtice, of Kindneſs, and of Mercy. Theſe are the Ends for which they were made; and, in them all, they are to do Service unto God.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> our <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to the Divine Law <hi>turns all theſe things another way;</hi> and makes the Holy God, in his Creation to be Inſtrumental unto Services which are quite contrary unto Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhall <hi>riſe,</hi> and make the Day, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that thoſe Sins may be acted, which require <hi>Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in the Commiſſion; When it ſhall <hi>ſet,</hi> and Night come on, merely for the accompliſhing of thoſe Vices, which need <hi>ſecreſie</hi> chiefly, and <hi>darkneſs.</hi> When <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> and <hi>Ill Nature</hi> ſhall ſtrengthen themſelves, by calling to their Aid whatever we poſſeſs, rather than fall unactive to the ground.

                  <p>Take, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the <hi>Malicious Man</hi> firſt, he cannot, it may be, do much againſt them whom he Hates; but he hath a Will to puniſh them Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, knew he but how. And this, methinks, thoſe ſevere Curſes too much ſpeak out, when he Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, upon any Diſpleaſure, bids God to Damn Them; and, as far as his Words and Wiſhes will do it, gives them over unto the Devil to be taken.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it any better with the <hi>Ambitious Man.</hi> He would be always riſing above others; and the Great God muſt for ever adminiſter to his Proud Wiſhes and Deſigns. If he, at any time, be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Hopes and Enterpriſes, he inwardly rageth, and is, in effect, ſorry that the Power of the Higheſt is not, ſo much, at leaſt, in his Hand, as that he may exalt himſelf above all other Men; and continue there, without any fear of ever being Lower; thus far God <hi>muſt</hi> always Serve him; and when he ſhould be accuſtom'd for ſome time to the greateſt Height on Earth, we have reaſon to think he would next wiſh to be the Supream of Heaven too, and to extort the whole Power from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the World.</p>

Alas, what ſhould we do, if we, and all things elſe were in the power of ſome Men! How miſerable would their Malice and ill Nature make us to be on Earth! Upon what light Offences ſhould we be ſent quick into Hell! How would Heaven lie open to Pride and Ambition! How all the Work of our Redemption be trodden under foot! And thoſe ſacred Laws, in ſo much Righteouſneſs and Mercy given us by our Lord, how turn'd into Confuſion! Nothing is ſo evil, but, might they have their Wills, God's Power ſhould ſerve for the accompliſhing and perpetuating of it. And not only his Holy Name and his Works, but his Perſon and Glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes ſhould be brought under, and made Vaſſals to their wicked Imaginations, and uncontroul'd Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>

                  <p>Here it is, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that Diſobedience hath its Loathſomneſs: For ſo far is the Almighty from being an Intruder, that there <hi>was no God formed before him, neither ſhall there be any after him, nor is there any beſides him. He is the only Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> and ſo he uſurps the Right of none, affects no unjuſt Power.

                  <p>Indeed the meaneſt Creatures upon Earth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſenſleſs in their Natures, do yet ſerve God: <hi>Even Snow and Hail, Wind and Storm, fulfil his Word;</hi> but then they know not that they fulfil it, and ſo their Obedience, in reſpect of themſelves, is leſs worthy.

                  </p>
                  <p>But Men he indued with a Reaſonable and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Soul, by which they conceive what it is they do, and why they do it: And ſo having a ſenſe of themſelves and their own ſtate, and, in ſome ſort alſo, of the Greatneſs and other Infinite Excellences of the Lord whom they ſerve, <hi>Their Obedience alone,</hi> of all Earthly Creatures, may be termed the <hi>Grace of Obedience;</hi> and <hi>They</hi> only have the Honour to be, in <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> and <hi>propriety of Speech, ſerviceable,</hi> and obedient unto God.</p>
                  <p>Yea, when Men had deſerv'd the Puniſhment of Death by breaking the Command of God, He, in infinite Mercy and Wiſdom, contriv'd a way for the ſaving them from Deſtruction, by the pretious Death of his Son.</p>
                  <p>And in relation hereunto, He hath, by that his Son, given them <hi>Commands</hi> that are not <hi>grievous,</hi> Laws that are righteous and good, perfective of their
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49802:149"/> Nature, and truly uſeful to Society. He vouchſafes Aſſiſtances from Heaven for the Performance of them, and promiſes Everlaſting Salvation after Death to thoſe who ſincerely obſerve them. And laſtly, He ſuſtains and preſerves them, even while they ſin againſt Him; when they could not breath, did not his Providence afford them Air; nor live, did not he give them Bread?</p>
                  <p>So that God may ſay to Theſe, as he did to his Vineyard, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. <hi>Judge, I pray you, between Me and Them: What could have been done more unto them, that I have not done?</hi> And for which of all theſe good Works do you throw Servitude upon me?

                  <p>A Man would admire indeed, that any ſhould be ſo abſurdly unreaſonable. For who would ever deſignedly bring himſelf into Diſhonour, and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49802:150"/> be the chief cauſe of that, which is moſt odious in his own Eyes? This, no wiſe Man, no, nor one but tolerably in his Wits, would ever do.</p>
                  <p>Let us but Attribute that Wiſdom to <hi>Him,</hi> whom we acknowledge to be <hi>infinitely Wiſe,</hi> which, in theſe Circumſtances, would never be wanting to <hi>any Man</hi> who hath <hi>Common Senſe and Reaſon,</hi> and we may be quickly ſatisfied that God compelleth no one to Vilifie his Holy Name, his Image, and his other Works; and to bring them into the Service of the Devil; to the great Satisfaction and Delight of that his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Let us not therefore ſay, <hi>It is through the Lord, that we have done thus; for we ought not to do the things which he hateth.</hi> Let us not ſay, <hi>He hath cauſed us to Err; for the Lord hateth all Abomination, and they that fear God, love it not;</hi> as the <hi>Son of Sirach</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſpeaketh, Chap. 15.

                  <p>They highly <hi>diſhonour God,</hi> who by their Diſobedience do carry themſelves Contemptuouſly. But yet thoſe Perſons, who make Him Himſelf to be the <hi>moving Cauſe</hi> of all this, do the <hi>more diſhonour him;</hi> becauſe they repreſent him as ſuch an one
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49802:150"/> who is not worthy of better Services than Wicked Men would Subject him unto.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Horrid abuſers they Both are of the moſt Righteous and Holy God.

Are not the Criminals encouraged to continue in their Wickedneſs? And others alſo drawn by their Example into the ſame Exceſs of Iniquity?

                  <p>There is a great deal of difference, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Thoſe</hi> who are Governors upon Earth. The Frail Condition of <hi>Theſe,</hi> in the poſſibility of their Perſons being really brought into Servitude, or deſtroy'd; and their Governments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weakned or wholly overthrown; requireth often times the ſpeedy Puniſhment of Thoſe who are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Offenders.</p>
                  <p>But God in his Perſon is ſecure from all the Evils that can be wiſh'd or attempted againſt him. And however his Government may, in appearance, be leſs'ned, yet, in reality, his Power and Dominion can never be endangered, or diminiſhed. For (as before was ſaid,) he is infinitely perfect, and ſo is no way ſubject to any Change for the Worſe, and therefore there is no need that God ſhould make that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49802:151"/> haſte to reſtrain or puniſh the Diſobedient as Earthly Princes muſt oftentimes, in Prudence, do.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, That many of thoſe Sins againſt God, which deſerve the ſevereſt Puniſhments, though they, by no means, can be for the Welfare of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety on Earth, yet do not immediately ſtrike at, and diſturb the Peace of the Community; or, at moſt, not in any eminent degree. And ſo the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Human Affairs doth not preſently call for God as a Revenger.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding theſe things, we may with Truth ſay, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> That ſome of thoſe who do with an high Hand ſin againſt Him, God <hi>ſomtimes</hi> makes Examples of his Wrath; and in them doth vindicate his own Soveraignty and Power, which they, as much as in them lieth, have brought under and trampled upon. And this he ſo doth, as that they themſelves may look upon it to be God's juſt Hand; and that others alſo may acknowledge it his doing.</p>
                  <p>But then, <hi>Communities of Men,</hi> which, by their publick Sins, make the Almighty to ſerve, are <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> when thoſe Sins are ripe, <hi>puniſhed in this World;</hi> for they cannot with any reaſon be thought puniſhable in the next; becauſe, all Bonds of Civil Society are utterly broken and evacuated by the Death of the Whole. Yea, and thoſe <hi>Private Men,</hi> who have contributed their ſhare to the Sins of a Nation as ſuch, are alſo oftentimes, in ſome reſpect, puniſhed in this World, even after Death, by Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Calamities reaching their Children, or other Relations, in whom themſelves are, in a manner, ſtill here continued. Which, to one who rightly conſiders it, ſheweth forth God's Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it is not always ſafe to pronounce, That the untimely Deaths, or unexpected Miſeries
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49802:151"/> of ſome particular Perſons, are an immediate Stroke of God upon them for their Diſobedience; (for our Chriſtian Charity will not permit this, when we know no ſignal Crimes by them.) And the great Afflictions of ſome, who are not <hi>greater Sinners than other Men;</hi> and of ſome, whom we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to eſteem as good Men, may caution us, in this point, not to be over-forward to Judge: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo we ſee a great many wicked Men to <hi>live and become old; to be in no Troubles as other Men; to die in peace, and leave the reſt of their Subſtance for their Babes;</hi> Therefore we may affirm it as a Truth,</p>
                  <p>Viz. <hi>That God ſeeth it fit generally not to cut off thoſe Men;</hi> nor yet to <hi>force them into Obedience, who by their Diſobedience do thus make him to ſerve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſeeth it fit generally not to <hi>cut them off,</hi> that they may have <hi>ſpace for Repentance.</hi> Thus did he to the Church of <hi>Thyatira; I gave her,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſpace to Repent of her Fornication:</hi> And for this end may he ſpare theſe, dealing with them as the Lord did with the Barren Fig-Tree, hoping that though they <hi>be not fruitful this year, they will grow better the next.</hi> And this the rather, becauſe from the thoughts of this Goodneſs of God unto them, they may the more effectually be prevail'd upon to repent. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the Riches of his Goodneſs and Forbearance, and Long-ſuffering, not knowing that the Goodneſs of God</hi> (in this his Forbearance and Long-ſuffering,) <hi>leadeth thee to Repentance?</hi> A <hi>Sorrow</hi> for former Sins, and an Acknowledgment of God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty for the future, in Mens giving themſelves up to his Service, <hi>may ariſe from other Conſiderations;</hi> but from none <hi>more directly or more forcibly,</hi> than from that of his <hi>ſparing them,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering them to live,</hi> that they may <hi>Repent</hi> and Turn unto him.</p>
                  <p>Neither may it be a ſmall Motive for his not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Cutting them off; that in caſe they do not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49802:152"/> there may, from their Freedom from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Life, be afforded unto us <hi>a ſtrong Proof</hi> that there will be <hi>Another Life</hi> after This; in which, thoſe Sins which are here ſpared and Unrepented of, ſhall moſt ſurely be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>God is a Righteous God, and he hath told us plainly by his Prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> Chap. 1.3. <hi>That he will not acquit the Wicked.</hi> And it is not Unobſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Theſe Words are put thus; to wit, <hi>The Lord is ſlow to Anger, and great in Power, and will not acquit the Wicked:</hi> As much as to ſay: Though he forbear long, yet it is not as if he could not puniſh; yea, if they ſhall go on in their Diſobedience, and not Repent them of their Miſdeeds, they moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhall have the Reward of their Doings.</p>
                  <p>Now, in that Theſe Wicked Men, who, to the utmoſt of their Power, make God to Serve, do <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten live</hi> and <hi>dye without Puniſhments,</hi> they muſt <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily</hi> be <hi>puniſhed after Death;</hi> or elſe <hi>God will,</hi> contrary to his Word, <hi>acquit the Wicked.</hi> But the <hi>Judge of the Earth will do Right;</hi> though all Men ſhall be Lyars, yet God cannot but be True: And therefore he will not Cut them off, that he may make them a ſtrong Argument that there will be a Day of Puniſhments, when this World is at an End with them.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly, Theophilus,</hi> we may not amiſs think, he will ſuffer them to Live, that if They Repent not. here, they themſelves may hereafter, in the Other World, <hi>confeſs</hi> that they are <hi>juſtly puniſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though Gods ſparing their Lives in ſo much Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when they had deſerved to be ſtruck Dead, or ſent Living into Hell, were little minded by them on Earth, it yet ſhall, at the Great Tribunal, have this effect upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> To make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that their <hi>Damnation is Juſt;</hi> becauſe They had ſo much favour ſhew'd them, and they ſhut their Eyes upon it.</p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:49802:152"/>
                  <p>And ſurely as Gods Gracious Deſigns of Mens Turning unto him, and being happy, do take off whatever can be Objected againſt his not preſently deſtroying the Diſobedient; So the <hi>Reputation</hi> of <hi>his Juſtice,</hi> which will by this means be Exalted, even among <hi>Thoſe that in Hell ſhall ſuffer it,</hi> may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Vindicate Gods Government of the World from being ſlack and remiſs, though he do not immediately Condemn unto Death thoſe who make him to Serve by their Sins.</p>

                  <p>One Reaſon may be; <hi>Becauſe he would have their Obedience to be their Virtue;</hi> and ſuch as ſhall <hi>become Rational Creatures to give.</hi> He, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Teacheth Them more than the Beaſts of the Earth; and maketh Them Wiſer than the Fowles of Heaven,</hi> that they may know what Good, and what Evil is; and may be ſenſible of the Favours that are ſhew'd unto them. He hath given them a Will to chooſe, or refuſe, what things are before them: And hath planted Affections in their Souls, by which Love and Gratitude may be Exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>Now, when they ſhall endeavour to Underſtand what is truly Good, and alſo what Gods Loving-kindneſs to them is; when they ſhall chooſe that which is beſt; and ſhall willingly ſerve Him whom they know to be the Lord of the World, and their Lord; Loving him for his Goodneſs, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to expreſs Thankfulneſs to him, ſo far as they are able; when, I ſay, they ſhall do this, they will be Virtuous, and ſhew themſelves ſuch as their Nature and Make require they ſhould be.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:49802:153"/>
                  <p>But how unagreeable would it be for theſe Men to be forced contrary to their Mind and Will? Wherein would they be Commendable, ſhould they do that which they could not help? And how unſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Love and Gratitude is Violence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint?</p>
                  <p>It is Love, that is chiefly acceptable from Men unto God: For He hath Loved them; and his Love ſhould be anſwer'd with Love again. But true Love proceeds by the Perſuaſive Way; and never ſhews itſelf aright but when it is Willing and Free; and is wrought upon by kind Inducements, and endearing Motives; which are things that are at the greateſt diſtance from Force.</p>
                  <p>Now, this perſuaſive Method God generally takes with Men, as being moſt ſutable to their Natures; and the proper way to prevail with them for that Obedience, which, as it ariſeth from their Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love, will be pleaſing in his Sight. He multiplieth his Favours upon them; ſendeth his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to quicken and excite him, by Sacred Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, and taking Suggeſtions; but never, with a mighty force to compel them; or, at moſt, very rarely; and that, upon very ſignal Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſomtimes he uſeth the Severer Way; partly out of Judgment, but yet out of Love too: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioning-Afflictions to fall upon them, if, by this means, he may prevail with them; yet always ſo, as that he leaves room for their Will; without which their Obedience would be of no worth with Him; and not their Virtue in the leaſt, nor any way fit for Rewards.</p>
                  <p>This may be one Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Another, why God will not Force them into Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we may conceive to be this; <hi>viz. That if they ſhall not by theſe gentle Methods be wrought upon, but
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49802:153"/> ſhall ſtill perſiſt in their Sins, He may ſhow his Power and Wiſdom, in improving into his Service, and to his Glory, thoſe their Sins, by which They,</hi> in appearance, <hi>made him to ſerve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus did he in the King of <hi>Aſſyria, Iſai.</hi> 10. High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proud this King was, and very great; and his Greatneſs, which conſiſted in large Poſſeſſions, and Multitudes of Men, (the Works and Gifts of God both,) muſt be employ'd to no other Ends but the bringing under others; though by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable Methods of Unrighteouſneſs and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
                  <p>Well; God ſees the Deſigns of this Haughty Man, and he will not preſently check him. The Jews were a Nation that had behaved themſelves ſo ill, that God ſtyles them <hi>the People of his Wrath.</hi> Againſt theſe now will God improve the Pride and Cruelty of this <hi>Aſſyrian;</hi> making Him his Rod to ſcourge Them: <hi>O</hi> Aſſyrian, <hi>the Rod of mine Anger, I will ſend him againſt an Hypocritical Nation, and againſt the People of my Wrath will I give him a Charge to take the Spoil, and to take the Prey, and to tread them down like the Mire in the Streets,</hi> Verſ. 6. But that you may ſee this King had no good Deſign, but the quite contrary, it is ſaid in the next Verſe, <hi>Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his Heart think ſo; but it is in his Heart to cut off Nations not a few:</hi> And therefore when God hath <hi>performed his whole Work upon Mount Sion and Samaria,</hi> in puniſhing them thus by the Pride of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> then will he alſo <hi>puniſh the ſtout Heart of that King, and the Glory of his Looks,</hi> Verſ. 12.</p>
                  <p>Thus thoſe Actions that are leaſt intended by Men to God's Service, will He by his Wiſdom engage for his own Service; yet ſo as that they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Sins ſtill in the Actors, and ſhall at the laſt have the Recompence that is due unto them.</p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:49802:154"/>
                  <p>After the ſame manner alſo is it in other Sins: In the Covetous, God's Gifts muſt ſerve their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Deſires; and muſt be heap'd up for this End chiefly, that the Owners may have as little a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon Providence as may be. And, could they think their Treaſures ſhould ever adminiſter to Free-handedneſs, and Liberality, it would be their Trouble. Yet theſe Men's ſordid Deſires and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, God, in his ſecret Wiſdom, ſomtimes will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſerve, after ſome years, in the good Offices of Charity and Pity; in that He, <hi>who by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury and unjuſt Gain encreaſeth his Subſtance, ſhall</hi> (when he little intendeth ſo,) <hi>gather it for him that will pity the Poor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Innumerable Inſtances might be given of God's improving the contrary Deſigns of Men into his Glory. I will only ſay this; That the Wiſdom of the Almighty is, on Earth, in nothing more ſeen than in this I now mention. His Service is hardly more frequently carried on by the pious and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Actions of good Men, than it is by the indirect and crooked Practices of the Diſobedient: God, as it were, <hi>ſecretly arreſting</hi> their ungodly Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and bringing them about, without any virtue of theirs, or thanks to them; ſomtimes that the <hi>Crafty may be taken in their own Craftineſs;</hi> ſomtimes that the <hi>Welfare of Good Men</hi> may be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; and, in all, that it may be known, That however Evil Men may endeavour to make Him, in his Holy Name and Works, ſerve their wicked Ends, He yet Himſelf is the <hi>Great God that Ruleth over all:</hi> And though <hi>many Devices may be in Mens Hearts,</hi> yet <hi>the Counſel of the Lord That ſhall ſtand.</hi>

                  <p>And whoſoever conſidereth This, together with the other Reaſons, before inſtanced in; why God doth neither Cut theſe Wicked Men generally off; nor force them into Obedience, will have no
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49802:154"/> cauſe to ſay, that God acted below the Wiſdom of Prudent Governors on Earth; That Criminals are encouraged to continue in their Sins; and Others to come in, and be partakers with them, by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

                  <p>But though God doth ſomtimes abſtain from puniſhing their Diſobedience, and ſomtimes doth improve it for the effecting of what He himſelf would have done, yet it is not thereupon the leſs Loathſome in its own Nature, and Deform'd. It tendeth, as far as poſſible, for ever to Diſſolve the Community betwixt God as a Lawgiver, and Men his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>And perchance we hence may not unmeetly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, how <hi>agreeably</hi> Rebellious Men <hi>are requited</hi> in being <hi>Eternally puniſhed in Hell.</hi> Their will would have had their wickedneſs uncontroul'd; and the pleaſures thereof extended to an infinite Duration; and God muſt thus for ever have Miniſtred unto them, to the Eternal Overthrow of all that is Sacred. They ſuffer therefore no longer than they would have Sinned: And it is not Incongruous that they ſhould for ever bear his Wrath, who, might they have had their Deſire, would for ever have made Him to Serve under Them, for the maintaining of their Iniquities.

                  <p>The coming on of Night tells us it is.

                  <p>It would be well if they would ſo do. For I dare appeal even to wicked Men themſelves, whether it would not ſeem groſly ill in their Eyes, if thoſe Servants, who, by duty, and many particular Favours, are obliged to Honour, Reverence, and Love their Good Maſter, ſhould, inſtead of doing That, cauſe Him to <hi>gird himſelf,</hi> and to <hi>Serve Them till they have Eaten and Drunk;</hi> and <hi>afterwards bid Him to Eat and Drink.</hi> Whether yet it would not ſeem much worſe to them, if theſe Servants ſhould conſtrain their Lord to <hi>thoſe ſhameful Actions,</hi> which the <hi>vileſt of Slaves</hi> would be thought <hi>too good</hi> for. I doubt not but ſuch Servants they would abhor; and think no puniſhments great enough for Them.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe ſtands worſe in their own making God Serve by their Diſobedience. For no Earthly Maſter can deſerve ſo much Honour and Love of a Servant, as God doth of Them. Neither can any Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, even in the moſt noiſome Circumſtances, be ſo loathſome to a Maſter here, as the Service of their Sins is unto God. And is it a becoming thing, that He, who is God over all, ſhould be thus Vilified by his own Creatures? That He, <hi>before whom the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Cover their Faces,</hi> and whoſe Courts, <hi>We,</hi> even in our beſt Services, are to approach with Fear and Reverence, ſhould be ſo far profaned, as, without any regard to his Greatneſs and Holineſs, to be brought lower than the meaneſt of all his Works; into a Bondage, of itſelf, uſeful to no good End? Sure, the Horrid Villany of the thing may make them abominate it. Eſpecially, ſince They, who, of all this lower World, are the meeteſt to Serve God, are the <hi>alone Creatures</hi> that Diſobey him. All things here, even to the meaneſt Worm that creeps, do his Will in their ſeveral places; and ſhall <hi>Men</hi> be the failing, yea, the Rebellious part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And, inſtead of ſerving God with the reſt of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49802:155"/> his Works, ſhall they force thoſe his Works from his Service; and themſelves make Him, by their Sins, to Serve?</p>

                  <p>In good Truth, while they thus do, they bring the greateſt Slavery upon Themſelves; in that they Serve many Maſters; and thoſe ſuch as are contrary the one to the Other.

A moſt uncertain Slavery it is, and no leſs difficult. What underhand Contrivances! What Glozings with thoſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide!

                  <p>THE great Deformity and Diſorder which Diſobedience carrieth along with it, are not things made probable by Diſcourſe only, and then growing leſs or none, when ſecond Thoughts and retired Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are engaged in them. The ſerious Reflection upon what you here laſt ſaid, gave Strength and Confirmation thereunto: And from thence my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions againſt Diſobedience, as a thing, in its own Nature, <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>deformed,</hi> grew the more ſtrong alſo.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> I have heard ſome, of none of the beſt Morals, endeavouring to extenuate the illneſs of Diſobedience, by ſaying, <hi>That they never malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſinned againſt the Almighty;</hi> Never wiſhed his Greatneſs and Power to be leſs; and by indulging themſelves in ſome things prohibited by the Sacred Laws, they <hi>gratified indeed their own Inclinations,</hi> but did no great Injury unto Men, <hi>much leſs deſign'd Ill unto God.</hi> Will the Plea of theſe Men ſtand them in any ſtead for the making their Diſobedience to be no ſuch thing, as yeſterday you diſcours'd of?</p>

                  <p>NO indeed, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> will it not. For what <hi>Quietneſs</hi> ſoever there may ſeem to be in their Sins, they will be found of dangerous Conſequence,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49802:157"/> if nearlier look'd into. It is not in Mens Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt God, as in thoſe againſt an Earthly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. There, Tumults are raiſed; Arms are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up; and the Diminution, or, it may be, the Deſtruction of the Prince wiſh'd and threatned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not out of a poſſibility of being weakned and deſtroy'd; and ſuch Methods are oftentimes likely enough to effect it. But God, becauſe he both is, and is acknowledg'd to be, Immortal, and out of the reach of all Force, hath no Swords drawn againſt Him; no Deſigns laid for his Overthrow; nay, is not by many ſo much as wiſhed not to be, becauſe they know ſuch Wiſhes are to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Their way therefore of Rebelling is to break his Laws; <hi>To think him ſuch an one as themſelves are;</hi> One who either cannot, or who will not, take any notice of them: Or, it may be, to <hi>Own Him,</hi> as to his <hi>Attributes,</hi> to be ſuch as he is, yet hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that their good <hi>Opinions</hi> of Him will <hi>make amends</hi> for bad <hi>Practices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how little do ſuch Thoughts mitigate their Sins? If they ſhall imagine God to be ſuch <hi>who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee them,</hi> is the Robbing him of his Omniſcience ſo ſmall an Offence? Becauſe it maketh no Noiſe, and with Calmneſs layeth Diſhonour upon Him, whoſe Eternal Glory it is to know all things, is it therefore an excuſable, good-natur'd fault? We may as well call <hi>Joab</hi>'s Carriage to <hi>Amaſa</hi> excuſable and good-natur'd, when he ſaid, <hi>Art thou in Health, my Brother?</hi> and then <hi>ſmote him under the fifth Rib.</hi> For God's Omniſcience cannot more ſurely be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown towards a Man, than by ſuch Imaginations; which, though in appearance mild, are <hi>deadly</hi> in the iſſue.</p>
                  <p>If they ſhall think, that God will not <hi>take notice</hi> of them; is it ſuch a moderate and harmleſs Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion to make the Holy and Good God, to favour
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49802:157"/> Intemperance? to look ſlightly on Unchaſteneſs? to be at good terms with Idleneſs and Sloth? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in relation to Mens Evil Thoughts of the Deity, ſaith, <hi>He had rather it ſhould be ſaid, There is no ſuch Perſon as</hi> Plutarch <hi>in the World, than that it ſhould be ſaid, He is after ſuch and ſuch a manner Vitious.</hi> And ſurely, theſe, who imagine God ſo vile as to approve of thoſe things which in Men are ſhameful, are no leſs wicked than they who deny there is any God at all. For his <hi>Being</hi> cannot be conceived to be Dear to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If laſtly, they ſhall own him, as to his <hi>Attributes,</hi> to be <hi>ſuch as he is,</hi> hoping that their good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall make amends for bad Practices, what a ſtrange Contradiction is this? They acknowledge him to be Juſt, that he may not puniſh Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Holy, that he may favour Impureneſs; True, that he may over-look Falſeneſs; Good, that Evil may not be diſcouraged: Can there be greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities offered unto the Holy One and the Juſt, than theſe are? Can any one be ſo wicked as to think, that becauſe he is not edged with a ſenſible ſpight in theſe things againſt God, he therefore is a very pardonable Sinner? Or can he be ſo fooliſh as to imagine, that theſe his Sins are wholly free from Maliciouſneſs? Were it ſo that Malice could effect any thing againſt the Almighty, it would quickly ſhew itſelf openly; but ſince it cannot, it lieth hid; yet hath the ſame pernicious Tendences, as if it appear'd more in view; and, in other Garbs, doth act the very ſame things.</p>

                  <p>I cannot ſay that there is the ſame Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Deformity in all Sins.

                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>Since there is none that is wholly free from Diſobedience, and Diſobedience hath a different Deformity in different Sorts of Men, Good and Bad; pray, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> tell me, what is the <hi>Spot</hi> of each; and <hi>wherein</hi> it is that they <hi>differ.</hi>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>I will endeavour to do it; and the rather becauſe it is of Material Conſideration as to what we have been diſcourſing.</p>
                  <p>As for Thoſe that are Good Men, They are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of <hi>Original Sin</hi> as much as any other: Since they were no leſs than others in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Loyns, when he tranſgreſſed Gods Command. And if a <hi>Clean thing cannot be brought out of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean one,</hi> there is a Pollution belonging unto Them. Their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they are Men, is Corrupted; Darkneſs and Error is in their Underſtandings: Their Wills and Affections are Irregular, and Prone to Evil; and their Bodies joyn their Allurements to the Evil Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their Souls.</p>
                  <p>And as thus they <hi>are</hi> not Clean from Original Sin, ſo they have many <hi>actual Sins</hi> ſpringing therefrom. <hi>David</hi> asketh a Queſtion at large, <hi>Who is it can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi> Even He, that moſt taketh heed to his ways, can <hi>He</hi> tell how oft he ſinneth? Beſides the Faults which he may have obſerved in himſelf, there are many ſecret ones which he may
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49802:158"/> pray to be delivered from. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though he knoweth nothing by himſelf, yet is he not thereby ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified;</hi> and ſo may every good Chriſtian ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Though he be not conſcious to himſelf, that at ſuch a time he ſinned; in ſuch a Concern he fail'd of his Duty; yet he cannot certainly plead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence before God. For his Offences reach further than his Knowledge; His Underſtanding, by reaſon of the firſt Parents Sin, being ſo imperfect, that many times he cannot diſcern the Failures he hath been guilty of.</p>
                  <p>But then the Diſobedience of Good Men, whether Natural or Actual, is, through the Grace of God, <hi>the occaſion of many Virtues</hi> in them, whereby they become acceptable in God's ſight.</p>
                  <p>The Imperfection of their Nature rendereth them <hi>humble.</hi> They, obſerving the many Defects that are in their Souls, and the depraved Conſtitutions of their Bodies, do ſee a great deal of reaſon for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>As their imperfect State in this World is a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> juſt upon them, they will bear it with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and not be tumultuous, and unquiet, as if God had dealt hardly with them. They will not behave themſelves <hi>proudly</hi> towards others, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Pity and Kindneſs rather become thoſe who are in the ſame Condemnation. Thus will they <hi>do,</hi> and thus <hi>be,</hi> while they conſider their imperfect State in this World to be their <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is their <hi>Sin alſo,</hi> and a Defilement upon their Natures, they will be affected with Sorrow; yet will not be <hi>deſponding</hi> and idle; nor ſo <hi>contented</hi> with their Sin, as not to endeavour to correct it by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Carefulneſs and Induſtry; knowing that it is the part of Negligence to let Original Sin he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddled with; and to reſt ſatisfied both in that, and in their other Sins; as if theſe did neceſſarily flow
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49802:159"/> from the Imperfection of their Nature, and could not any way be helped. They will make it their buſineſs to clear their Underſtandings, to rectifie their Wills; to reduce into order their untoward Appetites; and to bring under their Bodies; that though they cannot wholly wipe off their Original Pollution, yet the ill effects of it may be as few and as ſmall as they can poſſibly make them.</p>
                  <p>As for their <hi>Actual Sins,</hi> theſe ſtir up in them an <hi>Hearty Sorrow;</hi> an <hi>holy Indignation,</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> Troubled really they are, that they have offended ſo Good a God, and ſo Gracious a Father. Throughly angry with themſelves that they have made ſuch ill Returns to One who hath infinitely obliged them; and Revenging it upon themſelves by unfeigned Acts of Mortification.</p>
                  <p>Theſe their Sins will alſo occaſion their more <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> and <hi>fervent Devotion.</hi> They will freely, and without ſo much as hiding one, confeſs their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before God: Heartily acknowledging themſelves <hi>leſs than the leaſt of his Mercies.</hi> Earneſtly begging that He, through Jeſus Chriſt, will forgive them. They will not <hi>let him alone,</hi> will give him no Reſt, till they have obtain'd his Favour. And ſo, by how much they heretofore have, in the Commiſſion of Sins, been at a diſtance from God, they now, by ſeriouſly calling them into Remembrance, and truly repenting of them, will the more, and the oftner draw near unto God, in Prayers and other Acts of Religious Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Their former Sins beget in them the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of never Sinning <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>preſumptuouſly</hi> for the time to come. Thoſe Words in <hi>Job</hi> they will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and think them but meet to be ſaid unto God; <hi>I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not Offend any more That which I ſee not, teach thou me: If I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> The Remembrance
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49802:159"/> of their paſt Offences will quicken them to new pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and firm Reſolves of Upright Walking for the reſidue of their Life. They will ſay, <hi>I thought on my Ways,</hi> I conſidered my former Sins, and I am reſolved to <hi>turn my Feet to thy Teſtimonies.</hi> And as it is my full reſolution never more to commit Sins Willingly, ſo do thou by thy Reſtraining Grace <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy Servant from Preſumptuous Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they through <hi>Frailty</hi> and <hi>Overſight,</hi> or through any <hi>Eminent Temptation</hi> fall into ſome Sins, they will not <hi>continue</hi> in them, but get out of them as ſoon as may be. They may, as Travellers, (for themſelves are ſuch; they are Travelling towards Heaven,) they may, I ſay, as Travellers, ſomtimes by Chance, and againſt their Wills, ſlip into the Dirt; but they will quickly ſtep out of it; accounting it their Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that ever they were ſullied with it. Nay, if they fall into Sin, they not only will not continue in it, but from their Failings will become the more <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Perſuers</hi> of that which is good. As we often ſee our Beaſts (if I may be allow'd to uſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,) after a ſtumble to go the faſter, ſo will they, after a ſlip, make the more haſte in Heavens way. They will <hi>love God</hi> the more, becauſe by theſe new Offences they have the <hi>more to be forgiven them.</hi> From their own Sins againſt God, they will the <hi>more readily forgive</hi> the Sins which others have committed againſt them. They <hi>will redeem the Time,</hi> and do much in the few Years that remain, for thoſe good Actions which they have left undone, and for thoſe Offences which they have committed. And if ever Sins can be improved aright, it is when they are made Incitements to more Duty.</p>
                  <p>And, laſtly, The Sins which they, through frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, daily run into, and cannot by all care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be wholly free from, do excite and prompt them <hi>to long for that happy State after this Life,</hi> in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49802:160"/> which they ſhall be fully cleanſed from all Sin, and never ſhall give God the leaſt Offence more. When will the Time come that they ſhall be no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with daily Failures in their Duties! How long will it be that their Souls ſhall be perfectly bent to all Goodneſs, and their Bodies have the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Temper and Conſtitution taken away! <hi>O that they ſhould be conſtrained to dwell in</hi> Meſech, <hi>and to have their Habitation among the Tents of Kedar! O that they had Wings like a Dove; then would they fly away and be at reſt!</hi> They'll ſay, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly;</hi> that ſo, <hi>They, with all thoſe departed this Life in the true Faith, and Fear of God, may have their perfect Conſummation and Bliſs both in Body and Soul.</hi> Such earneſt Deſires do their frail and imperfect Conditions, and their every days Failings ſtir up in them.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the Sins of good Men have <hi>a Defilement in them;</hi> but ſuch as is <hi>eaſily diſcern'd</hi> from that of others.</p>

                  <p>Much different, I muſt confeſs, it is from the Deformity of Diſobedience, as you yeſterday Character'd it. The Sins of good Men owing more, as may ſeem, to the <hi>Frailty of Human Nature in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> than to the <hi>Wills of themſelves in particular.</hi> But I will now deſire you to ſpeak to the Sins of the other ſort of Men, <hi>viz. Thoſe who are Wicked.</hi>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>The Sins of <hi>theſe, Theophilus,</hi> are of a far deeper Die; and carry a much greater Deformity than the Sins of good Men do.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſpeaks of them as <hi>Scarlet</hi> and <hi>Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ones;</hi> not for the Beauty of the Colour, we may be ſure, but for the Depth of the Stain: For who can make Scarlet as Snow, or Crimſon white as Wool?</p>
                  <p>See we firſt the <hi>Sin of their Nature.</hi> And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not, in itſelf, greater than that of the better ſort of Men. For all Men in <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned equally;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49802:160"/> neither is one more guilty of that Sin than another.</p>
                  <p>But then herein conſiſteth the greater Deformity of wicked Men in reſpect of Original Sin. They are <hi>contented</hi> and <hi>well enough pleas'd with it.</hi> What evil Inclinations they have are not grievous to them. They eſteem their imperfect State as no unhappineſs at all: Are not in the leaſt affected with it; ſee no Puniſhment at all in it. Yea, they increaſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements of their Nature thus.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ignorance</hi> which from the Womb they have of Divine things, they <hi>improve</hi> into a <hi>Willingneſs</hi> that there ſhould be no God; and into a <hi>Readineſs to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute him</hi> out of their <hi>own Hearts,</hi> and <hi>out of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> World too:</hi> And would fain imagine him to have no Being at all, that they may not have ſuch an one to <hi>Raign over them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They <hi>encourage</hi> their <hi>depraved Wills</hi> by Obeying them as far as they can; and they would do it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if Fear, and Shame, and Loſs from Human Laws and Cuſtoms did not prohibit them: And that they are thus prohibited it is their inward trouble.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Corrupt Deſires</hi> they are ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing and keeping under, that they <hi>foſter</hi> and <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> them. It was an ill Character of one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours; <hi>Jacentes excitavit Libidines;</hi> He ſtirr'd up, and uſed Arts to awaken his Luſts, which otherwiſe would have been quiet and aſleep. So is it with theſe: They give no reſt to their vile Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and ſpur their depraved Nature to a greater height of Depravation.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider their <hi>Outward Actions,</hi> we ſhall find they are not <hi>equally notorious</hi> in <hi>all:</hi> But yet in <hi>all</hi> they are much different from thoſe of good Men.</p>
                  <p>Wicked Men, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> are of two ſorts. Thoſe that are <hi>more wicked,</hi> and thoſe that are <hi>leſs.</hi> For we read in Holy Writ, of a greater Damnation; and in Hell, we believe, there are Degrees of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49802:161"/> more intenſe for ſome, and leſs intenſe for others: And yet thoſe, who are in the leſſer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Torment, have been wicked Men.</p>
                  <p>As for the former and <hi>worſe ſort,</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks of them thus: <hi>They proceed from Evil to Evil. They weary themſelves to commit Iniquity. They bend their Tongue like their Bow to ſpeak Lyes. They lie in wait for Blood. They hunt every Man his Neighbour with a Net. They do Evil with both Hands earneſtly; Corrupt are they, and have done abominable Iniquity; They are altogether become filthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Deformity of Theſe is ſomtimes more <hi>open;</hi> ſomtimes more <hi>ſecret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some, were their Lives throughly look'd into, I Fear, without uncharitableneſs uſed towards them, they would be found to have wholly laid out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Service of Sin. Could the Time be Computed rightly which they have ſpent in Defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Oppreſſions; in Surfeitings and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs; in Defaming and Evil Cenſuring; in Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Lyes <hi>of,</hi> and <hi>unto,</hi> their Neighbor; in Begetting and Fomenting of Differences; in Acts of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Diſhoneſty; and, at the beſt, in giving up themſelves to Earthly Profits, or looſer Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; we may doubt the reſt of their Days would be very few; and their whole Lives little leſs than a <hi>continued Blot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are They generally, that are <hi>careful to avoid</hi> the <hi>being thought</hi> to be any whit <hi>Religious;</hi> and do Vilifie with Deriſion the Conſtant and Sober Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Devotion; being Strangers to the Name of God, unleſs in an Oath or Curſe, or other Vain ways of Speaking. Not unlike to thoſe in the Prophet, their <hi>words have been Stout againſt God;</hi> in <hi>that they have ſaid it is in vain to ſerve God; and what profit is it to keep his Ordinances? Mal.</hi> 3.14.</p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:49802:161"/>
                  <p>Such Spots as Theſe, are to every <hi>ones Eye</hi> of a deeper Stain than Thoſe of Good Men are.</p>
                  <p>But then the Pollution of ſome of Theſe, who are of the worſe ſort of Wicked Men, are more <hi>Secret</hi> than thoſe I have mention'd are. Secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in reſpect of Men; but altogether open to the Eyes of God.</p>
                  <p>Such is theirs, who will uſe a plauſible Deportment that they may the more ſecurely carry on, and act the worſt Deſigns. Somtimes that their fair De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor to ſome may be as <hi>Bribes</hi> to make them <hi>overlook</hi> their Enormities to Others. Somtimes that they may be the <hi>leaſt ſuſpected</hi> by <hi>thoſe,</hi> whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend moſt Miſchief unto. Of Theſe the Pſalmiſt may ſeem to Speak; in ſaying, <hi>the Words of their Mouths are ſmoother than Butter, having War in their Hearts: Their Words are ſofter than Oyl, yet be they drawn Swords. They Bleſs with their Mouth, but Curſe inwardly.</hi> Such as Theſe our Saviour means, when he bids his Diſciples to beware of Thoſe who <hi>come in Sheeps Cloathing; but inwardly are Ravening Wolves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they ſhall uſe <hi>Pretences of Religion,</hi> while they do ſuch things, they are the more deformed by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing like Chriſtians. As we juſtly account an Ape the more ugly for being like a Man, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt of Creatures, and not being One.</p>
                  <p>And if they ſhall <hi>for Religions Sake</hi> do theſe things; Contrive the Ruin of a Nation; Delight in Blood; Trample upon Laws, Government, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; Stifle the Dictates of Nature; and, in a Word, turn out all Religion, that they may intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce That which they miſcal Chriſtianity, (for This, ſure, is quite of another Spirit, and inſtructs us in the Exerciſe of Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs; Kindneſs and Mercy,) I ſay, if <hi>for Religions Sake,</hi> They ſhall do theſe Things, ſo Black is their Spot,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49802:162"/> that we have very good reaſon to ſay, it is not the Spot of Gods Children.</p>
                  <p>A Spot it is of the <hi>worſt ſort of Deformity:</hi> Since it doth, in a manner, caſt a <hi>Blot</hi> upon the <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>peaceable Religion of Chriſt;</hi> and renders it, in the Eye of thoſe, who are without the Pale of the Church, and who value the Goodneſs of Religion rather from the Practice of its Profeſſors, than from the Precepts which it gives; I ſay, it renders it in the Eye of Thoſe to be Vile and Odious. For, how ſecretly ſoever ſuch actings are carried on and maintain'd, they, for the moſt part, are <hi>found out at laſt;</hi> and Gods Providence doth in an eſpecial manner engage itſelf for the <hi>Detecting them;</hi> But yet though they be juſtly puniſhed, in being laid Open, and Condemn'd before Men, yet the Enemies of Chriſtianity look not ſo much on the <hi>Juſtice of their Puniſhment</hi> who were the Actors, as on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> which they profeſs'd; and ſo, that <hi>Holy Name is Blaſphemed,</hi> by which they were called.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, that Wickedneſs when it walketh <hi>bare Faced,</hi> and hath an <hi>Whores Forehead,</hi> is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as for its inſeparable Stains, ſo for its Acceſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Impudence. But there is the like Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sins I am now ſpeaking of, and thoſe which to Men are more Viſible, as there is between a Rock in the Sea, which appears above Water, and That which lieth under it. They are both dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and if Tempeſts ariſe, the Sailers may ſuffer Shipwrack on the One, as well as on the Other: But in a Calm Sea, that which is ſeen may be avoided; when upon the Other, while no Danger is feared the Veſſel may Split.</p>

                  <p>Such Deformity do Theſe Sins include, that they need not an over-Diſcerning Eye to tell us what Perſons they are to whom they belong. But, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> you were ſaying, that <hi>of Wicked</hi> Men, ſome
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:49802:162"/> were <hi>leſs Wicked.</hi> Pray, who are <hi>they?</hi> And what their Sins?</p>

                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>They may be ſuch as in their <hi>Converſe with Men</hi> are ſomtimes not much to be <hi>found fault with.</hi> But their Sins may be underſtood from the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe following Things.
<list>
                        <item>1. The Internal Obedience, and Cleanneſs of Heart, which the Precepts of Jeſus Chriſt require.</item>
                        <item>2. The Excellent Ends for which all the Actions of Men are commanded to be done.</item>
                        <item>3. Thoſe many particular Obligations which may lye upon them, for the being Righteous and Holy Perſons.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, then, though the outward Deportment be not Incommendable, yet if Internal Obedience, and Cleanneſs of Heart, be wanting, the Sins are thoſe of a wicked Man.</p>
                  <p>It was the Character of the Covenant which God made with Men under the Goſpel; to wit, <hi>I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and Write it in their Hearts, Jer.</hi> 31.33. And therefore what ever good Action they do outwardly, if they approve not of it in their Hearts; if they look upon their Civility and Honeſty, their Charity and Mercy, and other ſuch like Virtues, to be a <hi>Debt due to Cuſtom;</hi> and do within their own Hearts eſteem it their <hi>Slavery;</hi> and could wiſh themſelves rid of it, as of an Unhappineſs; ſecretly grudging at thoſe things, which yet they would have others Praiſe them for; their Sins are much different from thoſe of good Men.</p>
                  <p>For they who are in reality good Men, are to have their outward Actions to be the Expreſſions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Integrity; and in no reſpect to be contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. And unleſs the Soul ſhall caſt a Beauty upon
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49802:163"/> their External Practice, however it may ſeem fair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, who cannot ſearch and know the Heart, yet in the Sight of God there will be ſuch Pollution, as none that belong unto Him are ſtained with.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it will be, if <hi>(in the Second Place,)</hi> their Actions be not deſign'd to the Excellent Ends the Goſpel ſpeaks of.</p>
                  <p>Nothing ſhould be done by a Man, but what is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Gods Glory. Whether ye Eat or Drink, or whatever you do, ſaith the Apoſtle, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> And every thing alſo, which Men profeſſing Chriſtianity are to do, is to be done with an <hi>Eye to the Recompence of Reward;</hi> which is the Salvation of their Souls. And indeed whatever is to be done for the Glory of God, muſt be done for their Eternal Happineſs alſo; ſince the Glory of God is in nothing more ſeen than in the Everlaſting welfare of Men.</p>
                  <p>Now if God and his Glory be not in all their Thoughts; if ſome Under-Ends be the Chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their Actions; and they can look no higher than to the obtaining ſomthing in this World; if Praiſe or Profit, or Pleaſure be the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimate</hi> of their Endeavours and Aims; if the Life and Immortality, which by our Lord are brought to Light, be little accounted of, and not permitted to have any ſhare in what they do, their Sins have a Pollution beyond what Good Mens have.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſay, that even Religious Men muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, with an <hi>Actual Intention,</hi> in every the leaſt Action, have reſpect to Gods Glory, and their own Eternal Welfare. The Imperfection of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the many Circumſtances they may be in; and the quickneſs which is requiſite to many of their Actions, will not permit this. But an <hi>Habitual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> for Gods Glory, and their own Happineſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life is done, is abſolutely neceſſary. And where this is wholly wanting; where Temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:49802:163"/> are the only things that engage the Thoughts; where the good Actions that they do are ſteered only by Earthly Inducements; how <hi>little Diſcommendable,</hi> yea, or how <hi>much Commendable ſoever</hi> theſe Actions may ſeem to be, they are deeply polluted in the Judgment that God will make of them; and are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to none but the worſe Sort of Men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If the many particular Obligations which are laid upon them be not look'd into: If they are no more taken notice of than if they belong'd not at all unto them: If the Knowledge which they have, and the greater Capacities with which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd, have no better Effect than the Ignorance, and weak Abilities of the meaner ſort: If ſignal Mercies received make no Impreſſions of Gratitude upon them: If peculiar Motions, and ſtrong Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations from God's Holy Spirit, to ſuch and ſuch Duties, be not complied with; Though all their Behaviour in the ſight of Men be fair and innocent, yet I cannot ſay that their Spot is the Spot of God's Children.</p>
                  <p>For although we are apt to think, that Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in doing thoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous Deeds,</hi> which would be diſcernably bad in every one; yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that thoſe Actions which would <hi>ſave</hi> ſome Men of a <hi>Low Rank</hi> and <hi>Mean Capacities,</hi> would not be <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God in <hi>ſome other Men,</hi> were they not improved, in good ſort, according to thoſe Meaſures of Knowledge and Abilities which God hath given them. And, in the way of Life, the ſame fairneſs of Converſe ſhall not be alike innocent to many: But theſe ſhall be defective and unreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſight of Him who is the Judge of the Earth, and will judge Righteous Judgment, while the others ſhall be commendable and accepted.</p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:49802:164"/>
                  <p>I may give you this familiar Inſtance. If ſome Real Objects of Charity ſhall offer themſelves unto <hi>Two Men;</hi> the One of a <hi>Mean Eſtate,</hi> and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a <hi>very Great One;</hi> and theſe Two, in the conſtant Tenor of their Lives, ſhould do thus; <hi>viz.</hi> The Meaner according to his Abilities ſupply the Indigences of the Miſerable; the Other give al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, not <hi>according</hi> to his <hi>Abundance,</hi> but <hi>juſt as the Meaner Perſon hath done;</hi> you would, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> pronounce the <hi>former</hi> to be <hi>charitable</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>not ſo</hi> the <hi>later.</hi> Juſt ſo, greater Capacities and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; larger Aſſiſtances, eſpecial Favours, and peculiar Engagements to higher Degrees of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will be look'd upon by the All-wiſe God, to be, as it were, a <hi>larger Spiritual Eſtate</hi> which ſuch or ſuch a Man poſſeſſeth. If then with all this he ſhall do no more than juſt ſo much as ordinary Men, whoſe Abilities are much leſs, Engagements much fewer, and Mercies leſs ſignal; as you rightly condemned the Uncharitable Rich Man in thoſe Inſtances which were open to your view, ſo we ſhall not think amiſs, if we conceive that the Juſt God will not be pleaſed with <hi>This Man,</hi> who, in his Eye that ſeeth the Heart, ſtandeth not in unlike Circumſtances with the <hi>Other.</hi> For <hi>to whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required;</hi> and we have no reaſon to doubt but He, who hath received much, and returns but little, will be hardly more, if at all more, excuſable, than He who hath received little, and returns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Thus may it be in the ordinary ſeeming innocent Lives and Converſe of Men amongſt one another. A Pollution there may be, when yet we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it, and when we are <hi>bound to judge</hi> according to the <hi>beſt appearance;</hi> it being no more than Juſtice, and ordinary Charity to <hi>interpret things well,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we <hi>ſee nothing of ill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:49802:164"/>
                  <p>And from what hath been ſaid, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the Caſe, in thoſe things, which are acknowledg'd by all to be Sins, will be Evident.</p>
                  <p>That Sin may be a <hi>Pardonable Sin</hi> in <hi>one Man,</hi> when the very ſame to the Sight and Opinion of Men, <hi>will not be ſo in another.</hi> If the Man hath had cloſe and Earneſt Warnings of his Conſcience before; if there hath been, as it were, a Voice behind him, ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk in it;</hi> if the Motions of God's Spirit have more vigorouſly acted his Soul; if his Mercies have pointed directly to what he ought to do: And notwithſtanding all theſe things, (which are diſcernable only to God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,) he ſhall commit the Sin; The Sin, though the ſame in the common repute of Men, with what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committeth, ſhall yet be a much deeper Stain to <hi>This Man,</hi> than to <hi>That</hi> it would have been.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Theoph.</speaker>
                  <p>But, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> there are very heinous Sins of ſome <hi>more than ordinary Good Men,</hi> regiſtred in Sacred Scripture: As the <hi>Adultery and Murther</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>David:</hi> The <hi>Denial of Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Peter;</hi> as alſo the grievous <hi>Curſing and Swearing,</hi> which he, together with that his Crime, was guilty of. I pray you, what are we to think of theſe Sins? and what would you reply to thoſe unhappy Inferences, which too many Men are apt to make therefrom? As for Example, they will ſay;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That none of the Sins which they indulge themſelves in, are ſo great as <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Peter</hi>'s were; and ſo they have reaſon to be confident, that their <hi>own Sins</hi> are not the Sins of wicked Men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the ſame Sins, in full as aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Circumſtances in God's Children as in others, will yet not be look'd upon as ſo great Pollution in them, as in thoſe others; and this, merely upon the account that they are his Children. For <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. <hi>God hath not beheld Iniquity in</hi> Jacob; <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49802:165"/> hath he ſeen Perverſeneſs in</hi> Iſrael. And ſo, if they can perſuade themſelves that they are the Children of God, (which many times they eaſily can do,) how great ſoever their Sins already be, or, at any time hereafter, ſhall be, yet their Spot, they'll think, will not be more than the Spot of good Men.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eubul.</speaker>
                  <p>It is obſerved of ſome, that they are more skilful in the Failings of their Governours, than in their Virtues, or in their own Obedience. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner may we ſay of theſe: They are better verſed in the Faults of good Men in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, than in their Virtues and Graces; or in that Obedience which themſelves owe unto God.</p>
                  <p>In relation therefore to thoſe Sins of good Men, and alſo the ill Inferences which theſe Men are apt to make from them, we ſay, <hi>Theophilus,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That thoſe Sins, though great they were, were yet rather ſingle Acts than Habits of Sin. They were not approved of, nor contrived for, every day of their Lives; nor did they laſt for Years.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſingle Acts are rightly eſteemed not to carry ſo much Pollution as Habits do: Becauſe an Habit is acquired by Actions often repeated; and ſo includeth the Defilements of many ſingle Acts put together.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhall be ſaid, that the ſingle Acts of ſome heinous Sins may poſſibly carry a ſtain with them as great as ſome Habits of leſſer Sins; and that the Sins of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were <hi>gravioris Notae,</hi> of a deeper Dye; it cannot yet but be granted, that a ſingle Act of a grievous Sin is leſs polluting than the Habit of the ſame Sin.</p>
                  <p>But then, Secondly, Thoſe Sins, though very great they were, had Repentance following them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:49802:165"/>
                  <p>Look we upon <hi>David,</hi> and we ſhall find him grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in earneſt, and heartily affected with his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.2. <hi>Thine Arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thine Hand preſſeth me ſore; There is no ſoundneſs in my Fleſh by reaſon of thine Anger, neither is there any reſt in my Bones becauſe of my Sin. For mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are gone over mine Head; as an heavy Burden they are too heavy for me. I am feeble and ſore bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I have roared by reaſon of the Diſquietneſs of mine Heart.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. (which Pſalm he made, (as the Title hath it,) <hi>when</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to</hi> Bathſheba,) he mourns thus: <hi>Waſh me throughly from mine Iniquity, and cleanſe me from my Sin: For I acknowledge mine Iniquity, and my Sin is ever before me. Deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs, O Lord: Thou deſireſt not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, elſe would I give it: The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit; a broken and contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> I have the more largely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>David</hi>'s words, that you may thereby ſee how <hi>great his Grief</hi> was; how <hi>earneſt</hi> his <hi>Prayers</hi> for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and how <hi>deep</hi> an <hi>Anxiety</hi> had ſeized him, leſt God's Favour ſhould for ever have been with-held from him.</p>
                  <p>Nor was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sin without a remarkable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. It is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. <hi>Peter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the words of Jeſus, who ſaid unto him, Before the Cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice: And he went out, and WEPT BITTERLY.</hi> It was not a light grief, and a Tear or two that were quickly dryed up; but a <hi>Bitter Weeping;</hi> which words certainly do denote a very great and deep Sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe that think ſo well of their own Sins, from the thoughts of <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sins being ſo much greater than theirs; are they as ready to conſider theſe good Mens Repentance? Do they grieve for their own, as theſe did for theirs? Is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49802:166"/> the Burden of them heavy? Are they earneſt in the begging pardon for them? If not, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome good Mens Sins in Holy Scripture, will be a mean Argument for the concluding their own not to be the Deformities of wicked Men.</p>
                  <p>I may truly ſay, that the great Sins of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> if conſidered with their Repentance, are much leſs than thoſe Sins, which in themſelves are not ſo great, without Repentance. And ſo, there is ſmall reaſon for any Perſon, from the Failures of theſe Holy Men, to infer his own Spots to be none other than thoſe of Gods Children.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are more Ends than one, for which God hath cauſed thoſe Sins of his Children to be regiſtred in Sacred Story.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſay but one End might be, that thoſe who, in the like manner, have grievouſly fallen, may, through the Exerciſe of a like Repentance, have hope that they alſo ſhall not be refuſed. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>What things were written afore-time, were written for our Learning; that we through Comfort of the Scripture might have hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, a <hi>no leſs End</hi> is <hi>this; viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That thoſe who now live, and thoſe who ſhall live in the Generations to come, may, from the Falls of others, take the more heed <hi>that they fall not alſo.</hi> And if they ſhall fall, they may well think, that their caſe is not ſo good; becauſe they have had ſuch warning before, and yet have not been prevail'd upon by it, for the being more careful.</p>
                  <p>And then yet further; <hi>Another End,</hi> altogether as <hi>great</hi> as the other Two, why the Sins of good Men have been recorded in Scripture, is this; to wit,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſhewing how God hates Sin even in thoſe whom he loves;</hi> and how he will <hi>puniſh</hi> it, not only in their <hi>Perſons</hi> while they <hi>live,</hi> but in their <hi>Names and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:49802:166"/> when they are <hi>dead,</hi> even to the End of the World.</p>
                  <p>Some other things, beſides thoſe that have been well pleaſing unto God, (as <hi>Mary's</hi> Ointment was unto Chriſt,) <hi>ſhall whereſoever the Goſpel is Preach'd throughout the World, be ſpoken of alſo for a Memorial.</hi> To make it known that <hi>Sins</hi> of a <hi>deep Die</hi> are in <hi>his Children</hi> altogether as <hi>Odious</hi> to his <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as <hi>their Pious Actions</hi> are <hi>acceptable to his Love and Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, who is it that can have favourable Thoughts of Sin, when God hath put ſo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Holy Writ, as Warnings againſt Sin, on purpoſe that we ſhould have the more care to avoid it? Who is it that may flatter himſelf in his Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who ſhall rightly conſider, how God puniſheth the Memory of his own Children, and ſetteth a Mark of Diſgrace upon them, which ſhall laſt <hi>till Heaven and Earth do paſs away?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſurely very ſlightly, or very partially, looks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bible, who from the Sins of Good Men there, can encourage himſelf in his own Sin; and think that its Pollution is ſmall to Him, when it hath laid ſuch a Blot upon their Names, as muſt not, as cannot, be raſed out by any. Rather <hi>let him Hear, and Fear,</hi> and do himſelf, neither in the ſame, nor any other kind, ſo wickedly: As knowing, that though none need now to Fear that their Miſdeeds ſhall be Regiſtred in Books, which ſhall be of equal Authority with, and ſhall laſt as long as, the Bible, (for God therein hath wholly declared his will; and ſo, Divine Writings are not further to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,) yet the All-powerful, and infinitely juſt Lord hath other ways of puniſhing them; and of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting the Pollution of their Sin, both to themſelves and others, to be very great; how ſmall ſoever they at preſent think it.</p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:49802:167"/>
                  <p>But Fourthly, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> we may truly affirm that God will not eſteem the Sins of his Children, which are in themſelves as great as, and the ſame with, the Sins of Others, to be therefore the leſs, becauſe they are committed by thoſe who are his Children.</p>
                  <p>That is, if any who are his, ſhall be unjuſt in their Actions; Falſe in theſe Words, Intemperate, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt, or any other ways vitious; their Injuſtice, Falſeneſs, Intemperance, Unchaſtity, and whatever other Crimes they ſhall commit, ſhall be eſteemed as carrying the ſame Pollution in them, which the ſame Sins in others do. For no Relation that a Man can ſtand in unto God, can make Injuſtice to become Righteouſneſs; Falſeneſs to become Truth; Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance Moderation; and Uncleanneſs Purity, And the Reaſon is; Becauſe the Relation which they have unto God as Children, lieth chiefly in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Likeneſs</hi> unto him; and a partaking of the Divine Nature in its Imitable Perfections. Now Theſe conſiſt in a Spiritual Remoteneſs from Sin, and an hatred of it; as being themſelves contrary unto it. And therefore they can in no reſpect be thought to Extenuate, much leſs to caſt a Beauty upon That, unto which they are ſo extreamly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite.</p>
                  <p>Gods <hi>not beholding Iniquity in Jacob;</hi> and <hi>his not ſeeing perverſeneſs in Iſrael,</hi> can never be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of their Sins being <hi>overlook'd,</hi> or not <hi>taken notice</hi> of by him, upon the mere account that they were his Children. For how grievouſly hath God complain'd of them? <hi>I have ſeen</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Moſes,) this People, and behold it is a Stiff-Necked People; now therefore let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot againſt them,</hi> and <hi>that I may conſume them; and I will make of Thee a great Nation.</hi> And how often hath he threatned, and ſeverely puniſh'd their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities?
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49802:167"/> Surely <hi>Balaam himſelf</hi> underſtood not Thoſe his own words, as Theſe Men are too forward to do. For had he ſo done, why ſhould he have Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd <hi>Balack.</hi> That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the <hi>Midianitiſh Woman</hi> ſhould be allured to Treſpaſs againſt the Lord, that thereby they might be <hi>excluded from his Favour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Iniquity therefore in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and Perverſeneſs in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are not to be underſtood of <hi>their own Sins,</hi> againſt either God or Men; but of the <hi>Iniquity and Perverſeneſs of Others</hi> againſt <hi>Them.</hi> Which thing the next Verſe, but one, doth very well ſhew: Where the very ſame Prepoſition <hi>in</hi> (which the Margin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,) with Relation to the very ſame Words, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and Iſrael,</hi> is rendred <hi>againſt. Surely there is no Inchantments (in) againſt Jacob; nor Divination (in) againſt Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 23.23.</p>
                  <p>And Gods <hi>not Seeing,</hi> and <hi>not Beholding</hi> denote his <hi>not approving,</hi> or <hi>not enduring</hi> it to be. So that the Senſe of the Words is; not that he will not <hi>ſee</hi> Iniquity and Perverſeneſs <hi>in Them,</hi> if they ſhall be Guilty; but that he will not <hi>ſuffer</hi> Iniquity and Perverſeneſs <hi>againſt</hi> Them, if they ſhall be Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſo far will the Relation of being Children unto God, be from leſs'ning the Pollution of any Heinous Sin, that it will be a very great Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Heightning of it; and will render it the more diſpleaſing unto Him.</p>
                  <p>That Thoſe who have given up their Names unto Chriſt; who have ſeen the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs;</hi> who have <hi>taſted of the good Word</hi> of God, and have been <hi>waſhed</hi> and <hi>cleanſed,</hi> ſhould commit Sin; <hi>loſe their firſt Love;</hi> fall away; and <hi>wallow in the Mire again;</hi> how Odious in the Sight of God will it be! Theſe, though they ſhould be <hi>the Signet on his Right Hand,</hi> He, without their unfeigned Sorrow and Repentance,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49802:168"/> would <hi>pluck them thence;</hi> as he ſpake of <hi>Coniah, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> 22.24. <hi>God is no Reſpecter of Perſons;</hi> But as <hi>in every Nation He that feareth Him, and worketh Righteouſneſs,</hi> is <hi>accepted</hi> with him; ſo <hi>He</hi> that <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Wickedneſs</hi> is <hi>rejected by him.</hi> As he is Judge of all the Earth, he will do right; and by no means will clear the Guilty.</p>
                  <p>He may ſooner put <hi>off the Title of Father</hi> to ſuch or ſuch an One, than he can <hi>lay aſide</hi> the <hi>Name of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Juſt.</hi> His being a Father to any Man, is with Relation to his Obedience, which is mutable, and may be withheld: And if Obedience ſhall be wholly withheld, the Man ceaſeth to be his Child; and God is no longer unto him a Father, in a Senſe that betokeneth Love and Delight in him; But He who is moſt contrary unto God, putteth on that Relation: <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil;</hi> ſaith our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>But then Holineſs and Juſtice are Eſſential unto God; and cannot by any Condition or Carriage of Men be parted with. And ſo, by Theſe, be Wickedneſs and Pollution in what Perſons ſoever they will, He rightly will diſcern, and puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>God indeed is ſaid <hi>to Love with an Everlaſting Lvve; Jer.</hi> 31.3. Which yet is not ſo to be underſtood, as if he were a <hi>fond Father,</hi> that <hi>could</hi> not ſpy the Faults of his Children; or <hi>would</hi> think them <hi>lighter</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> than they are; but He is ſaid <hi>to Love Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly,</hi> in that he will <hi>never fail Thoſe</hi> that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entially ſeek unto, and depend upon him; and will always afford ſufficient means for their abiding in his Love; as well as, at the laſt, infinitely Reward them for Loving and Obeying him.</p>
                  <p>And He is pleaſed alſo to ſay, he <hi>Loveth with an Everlaſting</hi> Love, in oppoſition to thoſe Earthly Parents, who ſomtimes have <hi>no natural Affection,</hi> and ſo do not Love; and ſomtimes may <hi>want means</hi> and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49802:168"/> 
                     <hi>abilities</hi> to expreſs their Love. <hi>Thus when my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother forſake me, (i. e.</hi> either for want of Will do not love me, or for want of Power cannot ſhew it as they would,) <hi>the Lord taketh me up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet if his Child ſhall grow diſobedient, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Love with Preſumption, and carrying it quite otherwiſe than a dutiful Child ought to do; Gods Eyes are open to the Faults of ſuch his Son, and he will uſe his Rod of Correction towards him.</p>
                  <p>Yea, if his Son ſhall <hi>grow ſtubborn</hi> and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; <hi>Shall not hearken unto his Voice, but be a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard or a Glutton,</hi> (as it is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.20.) or any other way profane and diſſolute, He will caſt him off, and diſinherit him; and it will not be the <hi>failing of his Love,</hi> but the <hi>Expreſſion of his Juſtice and Holineſs ſo to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Agreeable hereunto is that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 18.24. <hi>When the Righteous turneth away from his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, and doth according to all the Abominations which the wicked Man doth, ſhall he live? All his Righteouſneſs which he hath done ſhall not be remembred; in the Treſpaſſes that he hath treſpaſſed, and in the Sin that he hath ſinned ſhall he die.</hi> And in this his dealing, God appealeth to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael, if his way be not equal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> I have conſidered the Sins of good Men in Holy Scripture, together with the ill Inferences which ſome Men are apt to make from them.</p>
                  <p>They look not upon them as the Sins of good Men, who take not the Repentance together with the Sins. And they are much miſtaken, who think that thoſe Sins are there mention'd only to ſhew how far God's Children <hi>may fall;</hi> and do not conſider them rather as <hi>Puniſhments</hi> to their Names, who thus offended God; and as <hi>greater Cautions</hi> to us, that we, from their Falls, may ſtand the ſurer.</p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:49802:169"/>
                  <p>Yea, They deal treacherouſly with themſelves, who, from the Sins of God's Children in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will flatter and encourage themſelves in their own.</p>
                  <p>And they moſt groſly and dangerouſly err, who, (thinking that God will eſteem the Sins of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which are the ſame with thoſe of others, to be leſs in them, merely becauſe they bear the Name of his Children,) will ſtrongly imagine themſelves to be Gods Children, that ſo their Sins (though great they be, and are like never by true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be leſs,) may not be the Spots of wicked Men. Theſe much wrong the Righteouſneſs and Purity of God. Theſe make Faith in Chriſt, <hi>which worketh by Love,</hi> to be the ſpurious Iſſue of their Fancy; and by thus untowardly thinking their Sins to be the Sins of <hi>God's Children,</hi> they the <hi>more ſurely</hi> make them the Sins of the <hi>worſt ſort of wicked Men.</hi>

                  <p>Would Men from ſuch things as theſe, deal impartially with themſelves, ſome dangerous Miſtakes, which they are willing enough to foſter, might be corrected.</p>
                  <p>And what, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> if they ſhould ſeriouſly ask themſelves theſe, or ſuch like Queſtions? <hi>viz.</hi> Are we contented, and well enough pleas'd with our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, and the Imperfection of our Nature? Are we at no time affected with ſorrow at it, as being our Sin? and do we never with a relenting Eye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it our Unhappineſs, as being our Puniſhment? Can we ſit idle under it, and not endeavour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it, by purging our Underſtandings of their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49802:169"/> our Wills of their Pravity, and our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their Corruption? Doth the ſenſe of it never encline us to Humility? And are we never thereby excited to pity others, who are thus pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and unhappy as well as we? Or yet worſe than ſo: Do we encreaſe the Defilements of our Nature, and ſtudiouſly promote and ſtir up our vile Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which otherwiſe would have been more quiet?</p>
                  <p>And then for <hi>Outward Actions.</hi> Are our Lives al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly liv'd out in Sin? Can we proceed from one Wickedneſs to another; and do Evil with both Hands earneſtly? Or elſe, if outward Shame hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from Evil Practices openly, and <hi>in the Sight of this Sun,</hi> do we Clandeſtinely Act them? Or is our behaviour Plauſible and Civil, merely that we may the more ſurely, and with leſs Suſpition, carry on Evil Actions and Deſigns?</p>
                  <p>Or, if there be none of theſe outwardly notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bad Actions, nor ſecretly Wicked Deſigns, yet are the chief Ends nothing look'd unto, in what we do? Is the Glory of God juſtled out by the Under-Aims of Earthly Profits or Pleaſures? And doth the Salvation of our Souls, through Unbelief or Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, weigh little or nothing with us, in reſpect of Advantage, or Reputation among Men?</p>
                  <p>Have the particular Obligations, by Almighty God laid upon us, not been minded, or not taken notice of by us to any good effect? Have our greater Knowledge and Abilities been improved to no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Services, than the Ignorance and Weakneſs of the meaner Sort have been? Have the ſtronger Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Gods Holy Spirit fallen Fruitleſs upon us? And thoſe Suggeſtions, which, at ſome times, we in a more than ordinary manner have had, and in which the Hand of God hath peculiarly been, have they been refuſed, and not complied with? In the Sins which we have committed, hath there been no
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49802:170"/> Unfained Sorrow? No Indignation at ourſelves for making ſuch ill returns to ſo Gracious a God, and Father? Have our Devotions been none, or very Faint and Cold ones after our falling into Sin? Have our former Faults begot in us no Reſolutions of not Sinning knowingly and Preſumptuouſly for the time to come? Do we, when tempted to commit a Sin, not only yield to it, but continue in it? Are we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after it more earneſt perſuers of that which is Good? And do the Frailty and Weakneſs of our Natures, and the Sins, which, while we are in the Body, we ſhall never be free from, at no time prompt us to long for that Happy Day, when we in Heaven ſhall do Gods Will, without Carefulneſs, Drowſineſs, and Imperfection? If, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> they ſhould thus queſtion themſelves, and ſhould find it no otherwiſe with them than what might be reducible to ſome or more of the particulars now mention'd, they might make a Judgment, whether their Sins are ſuch, as belong to <hi>the Worſe,</hi> or <hi>leſs Evil</hi> Sort of Wicked Men; but would have no reaſon to think them <hi>only the Failures of Good Men.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed, <hi>Eubulus,</hi> ſhould Men thus be Judges of their own Miſdeeds, they would not be more, than what they well might. Some of their Sins, poſſibly, which cannot ſo well bear the being look'd into, leaſt their Pollution and Deformity ſhould be diſcovered, might be apt to ſay, <hi>ye take too much upon you;</hi> and <hi>who made you Rulers and Judges over us?</hi> But certainly Men have a Power over their own Doings; and may ſearch their own Hearts; and Examine the Riſe, and Progreſs, and Deſign of their own Actings; and need not fear that any ſhould ſay unto them, Why do ye thus?</p>

                  <p>It is, I confeſs, not the leaſt part of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for Men to <hi>know Themſelves.</hi> The being skill'd in the works of Nature, and in the Arts and Sciences. The ſeeing into future Times; and <hi>underſtanding all Myſteries, and all Knowledge,</hi> would be of ſmall avail with them, without the Knowledge of their own Sins. For where theſe are not known, there is very ſmall hope that a Cure and Amendment will be wrought. And what would it profit a Man, to be otherwiſe, in all reſpects, accompliſhed, and yet to go out of the World with his Sins unknown, and ſo not repented of?</p>

                  <p>I am perſuaded, <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that the great reaſon of ſo many Mens continuing in their Sins, is becauſe they are not willing to ſearch into them. Let them be throughly look'd into, and the Cover taken off from their Deformity, and they will find few that will not loath them.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>David</hi> had <hi>conſidered his ways, i. e.</hi> had found the Spots and Defilements which his Sins car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in them, he <hi>turned his Feet to Gods Teſtimonies. He made haſt and delayed not to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And would Men generally do as He did, I have no cauſe to doubt, but, through Gods Bleſſing, there would be the ſame good Iſſue to <hi>Them,</hi> as to <hi>Him</hi> there was. Nay, I am ſure, if Pollution and Deformity will Create a Loathing, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Loath the Diſobedience they have ſo long In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.</p>

                  <p>Happy it would be, if Men, from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Shame,</hi> would ceaſe to be Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; but, ſurely, the Defilement and Deformity which Sin caſteth upon them, ſhould prevail with them moſt. And where they, from this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion chiefly, ſhall abſtain from Iniquity, they will be, if I may ſo ſpeak, the <hi>more generouſly Innocent.</hi>

                  <p>They, by ſo doing, will turn thoſe Spots that mark'd them as wicked Men, into the <hi>Spots of God's Children.</hi> And, at the laſt, when their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be raiſed Spiritual and Incorruptible,</hi> they will leave <hi>even theſe Spots</hi> alſo behind them. Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into the <hi>Heavenly Jeruſalem, where nothing ſhall in any wiſe enter that defileth;</hi> and where they will be for ever arrayed in <hi>fine Linnen clean and white, the Righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi>
